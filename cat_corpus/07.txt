Just when we thought dogs were the darlings of fall fashion , the National Capital Cat Show in Washington, D.C., graced us with a fabulous feline fashion extravaganza that was just as glitzy and glamorous as New York Fashion Week .
The video below includes a Selkirk Rex striking a pose in a spectacular patriotic ensemble, a Sphynx strutting her stuff in a glamorous black gown and matching cap, an Exotic Shorthair looking fierce in a purple frock adorned with flowers and more. What are you waiting for? You have to see these feline fashionistas in action.
