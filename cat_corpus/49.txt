Top 10 Fantastic Feline Facts
 
 
Got a cat? While you probably know lots about the furry feline, we bet there are some fantastically fun facts you don't know. Here are our top 10. 
  
#10 Ambidexer-cat?
You probably never thought about a cat as being either left- or right-pawed, but over 40 percent are either lefties or righties. That means there's quite a few out there who are ambidextrous. Luckily for them, they can probably operate the can opener with both paws ...
 
#9 Warm or Cold?
Food that is. Cats don't like their food too hot or too cold. They like it just right. And for them, just right is room temperature, just like their prey would be in the wild. Cats are indeed the Goldilocks of the animal world.
 
#8 In Living Color
Cats see in color, so your new paisley frock in orange, purple, and yellow won't be lost on them. They also have fantastic night vision, and only need one-sixth of the light humans require to see. So don't go getting your cat night-vision goggles.
 
#7 What's in a Name?
A group of kittens is called a "kindle" (yes, just like that fancy new electronic book device available now), while a group of adult cats is called a "clowder."
 
#6 Meow?
We all know the meow sound, whether it's questioning, scared, happy, or imperiously demanding dinner. Curiously, cats only meow at people, not at other cats.
