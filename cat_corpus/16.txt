We don't know about you, but this cat had us at "oh long John."

Call us prospectors, 'cos this here is YouTube gold.
8. The OMG WTF Cat
Don't watch this if you're feeling a bit grumpy and want to stay that way.
9. Hungry, Hungry Kitteh!
The human may win out in this clip, but we would not want to be on the receiving end of the small cat's vengeance in the weeks (years?) to follow.
10. Surprised Kitty
Excuse us please, our hearts just imploded with cute overload...
