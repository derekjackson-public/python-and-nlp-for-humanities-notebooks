Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory infection of the nose and throat in cats. It is caused by, and also know as feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1).
Cats of all ages are susceptible, but kittens are at a higher risk and may be infected at about five weeks of age. Pregnant cats or those suffering from a lowered immunity due to a pre-existing disease are also at higher risk.

Sudden, uncontrollable attacks of sneezing
Watery or pus containing nasal discharge
Loss of sense of smell
Spasm of the eyelid muscle resulting in closure of the eye (blepharospasm)

Inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eye ( conjunctivitis )
