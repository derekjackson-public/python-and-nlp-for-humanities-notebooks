Even when you're dealing with the top viral videos of all time, you're taking risks. Whenever someone sends you a link to a video, if you're at work, it's almost like defusing a bomb. The longer it takes, the guiltier you feel. The best short YouTube videos take some of the tension out of the experience. Ranker does the rest.
So, all in one place, here are the greatest, short (as in, only around 20 or so seconds in length) viral videos/YouTube sensations in internet history. From 2005 to today. Most of these are classics. Many are among the funniest viral videos ever. All of them are awesome.
