Excessive Cat Sneezing and Nasal Discharge
 
Why Is My Cat Sneezing a Lot?
 
Almost anything that irritates or tickles a cat's nose can trigger a sneeze, but if your cat or kitten sneezes a lot you may start to worry that there's something wrong. If sneezing is the only symptom your cat displays—i.e., no discharge from eyes or nose, good appetite, no change in behavior or activity level—then something as simple as an allergy or contact with irritants like cigarette smoke or air fresheners may be to blame. However, if your cat's sneezing in accompanied by a runny nose and eyes, he might have an upper respiratory infection.
 
Do Cats Get Colds?
 
The viruses that cause colds in people are generally species-specific. Except perhaps under the rarest of circumstances, the viruses that make people sick with a cold are incapable of causing illness in cats. So if you're wondering "can cats catch a cold from people," the answer is almost always "no." On the other hand, several feline viruses (e.g., feline herpes virus and feline calicivirus) and even a few bacteria do cause clinical signs that look a lot like those that people with colds develop. Upper respiratory infections can occur in any cat but are most common in kittens or under-vaccinated adults who have had contact with other cats.
