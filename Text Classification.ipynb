       "{0: ' Shortish note on JAWS support for regions  Posted on Saturday, 28 July 2018 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development   The JAWS screen reader has fairly recently changed the way it supports the announcement of ARIA landmark roles and HTML5 elements that map to landmark roles. This has lead to some confusion for people when testing the support for these features. Tester expectations and implementation realities There are defined requirements that browsers follow for interoperable implementations of features in the accessibility layer.  HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 Accessible Name and Description Computation 1.1 SVG Accessibility API Mappings  These specifications define, for example, what is to be exposed in the browser accessibility tree for a button element. What the specifications do not say is how this is to be presented to the user in an aural UI. There is a general expectation that this information will be conveyed to users, but in what contexts and in what forms, no requirements are defined. There is some advice provided for some elements in the HTML specification, for example: Assistive Technology may convey the semantics of the nav to users. This information can provide a hint to users as to the type of content. For example the role of the element, which in this case is “navigation”, can be announced by screen reader software when a user navigates to an nav element. User Agents may also provide methods to navigate to nav elements. But these are not normative requirements and do not dictate the form of support. There are not defined requirements for how Assistive Technology, such as screen readers express the information conveyed in the browsers accessibility layer. Some of the ways accessibility layer information is supported by screen readers:  Identification of an element by role as the user moves through the content. Announcement of the text content of an element. Announcement of the start and end of an element. Change in voice as the content of an element is announced. Announcement of states and properties. Announcement of an elements accessible name and/or description. Announcement of states and properties. Emission of a beep or other sound when an element with a particular state or property receives virtual focus. Instructions on how to operate interactive elements such as form controls. Navigation of elements by keyboard and “quick access” lists of a particular elements, list items are linked to each instance of an element on the page.  Which brings us back to JAWS and landmark support. JAWS supports landmark regions, but how that support is expressed depends on the “Web Verbosity” settings in JAWS. JAWS has a “Web Verbosity Level: Low/Medium/High” You can view/set this by opening the Settings Center and expanding the “Web/HTML/PDF” tree item and selecting the “Reading” item. The default verbosity level is “Medium” If you press the “Medium…” button the configuration dialog will be displayed. What this shows is a list of HTML features and if a feature is checked it will be announced during virtual cursor navigation, arrowing through the content, or during “say all” or when navigated to using the virtual navigation quick keys. (A list of these navigation keys is documented in the JAWS HTML standards support documentation). What you will note is that at the default “medium” verbosity, only a subset of the landmark regions are checked, thus only these regions will be announced. Note this does not mean that the user cannot navigate to the unchecked regions using the region navigation keys: R/Shift+R, it means that when navigated to the content of the region will be announced without denoting the regions start and end. Too much information Why is the announcement of some features turned off by default? In talking with users and the JAWS developers the answer is that some users sometimes find web pages “too chatty” and want some aspects of the support provided (navigation), without the noise (announcements). This behavior can lead some people to think that JAWS does not support a particular feature, when it does, but not in the way you expected.

The simplest gesture involves swiping the screen from left to right by using a finger to navigate through page content. While there are many other gestures to support speedy navigation, a useful rule of thumb is for developers to try to reduce the number of swipes required on a page (without missing out on necessary content). In theory, this should improve the experience for those people who use VoiceOver. Reducing the number of required swipes is particularly helpful when supporting form navigation. In HTML, assuming a developer has applied the for attribute to the label element, and its value matches the id attribute of the related input, only the input will fall into VoiceOver swipe focus order, and VoiceOver will read out the label text – for example, “First name, text field”. Unfortunately, there is no concept of providing matching for and id attributes when developing native iOS applications, hence I sometimes encounter cases where navigating through forms, and particularly large forms, can be a bewildering process. To illustrate, let’s take an example. Imagine you have a form that contains three simple text fields:  Name Nationality Age  For each of the above three components, you may decide to drop these onto the storyboard in Xcode as follows: a Label to represent the visible label, and a Text Field to represent the related input, as in the following screenshot:  Unfortunately, many beginners’ guides to Xcode development I encounter stop there. While it is visually obvious how the labels and associated text fields match up, this isn’t so obvious to VoiceOver users. For example, if I run the above example on an iOS device, the label is announced first. When I swipe to the related text field, VoiceOver simply announces “text field”. The problem with this approach is twofold:  If I navigate forwards through the form (i.e. swiping from left to right), it is reasonably obvious to identify how the text fields relate to their associated labels; that is, the label is announced by VoiceOver, followed by the text field – which is announced as “text field”. However, if I decide to swipe backwards through the form (because, say, I have forgotten to fill in a field), or I am using explore-by-touch (holding the tip of the finger on the page and moving it around until I locate the content I require), “text field” on its own does not clearly indicate which label the text field relates to. Consequently, I may enter the wrong data into the wrong text field. Both the label and the text field fall into VoiceOver swipe focus order as separate elements. This means that, in the above example, a VoiceOver user must swipe six times (once for each component) in order to reach a Submit button.  To deal with the above issues, here are my recommendations. Make sure that all form controls are labelled programmatically The first step is to ensure that you provide an accessible label for each of the text fields. You can do this in one of two ways:  Provide a label for the text field in the Identity Inspector. Make sure the text matches up exactly with the visible label. Or: Provide a label for the text field at code level, by applying the accessibilityLabel property to each text field. Again, make sure this text matches up exactly with the visible label.   The rest of this post assumes the second approach is taken, but either method is acceptable. Example code for labelling form fields (note: for illustrative purposes only) @IBOutlet weak var nameTextField: UITextField! @IBOutlet weak var nationalityTextField: UITextField! @IBOutlet weak var ageTextField: UITextField!  class ViewController: UIViewController { … \\toverride func viewDidLoad() {         super.viewDidLoad()         // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. \\t \\tself.nameTextField.accessibilityLabel = \"Name\"; \\tself.nationalityTextField.accessibilityLabel = \"Nationality\"; \\tself.ageTextField.accessibilityLabel = \"Age\"; \\t\\t     }      override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {         super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()         // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.     } … } Now, whenever any of the text fields receive focus, the label will be announced. For example, VoiceOver will announce “Nationality, text field” when the Nationality text field receives focus. Hide visible text labels from VoiceOver users However, the above technique only partially resolves the issue. If a VoiceOver user swipes down from the top of the page, they will hear the visible label, and then by swiping right they will hear the label text again as part of the text field. This obviously results in duplication. To resolve this issue, apply the isAccessibilityElement method to each of the visible labels, and set each to a value of false. This removes each of the visible text labels from VoiceOver swipe focus order. Consequently, only the text fields themselves are focusable, which reduces the number of swipes required through the form from six down to three. Example code for removing visible text labels from VoiceOver swipe focus order (note: for illustrative purposes only) @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var nationalityLabel: UILabel! @IBOutlet weak var ageLabel: UILabel!  @IBOutlet weak var nameTextField: UITextField! @IBOutlet weak var nationalityTextField: UITextField! @IBOutlet weak var ageTextField: UITextField!  class ViewController: UIViewController { … \\toverride func viewDidLoad() {         super.viewDidLoad()         // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib. \\t \\tself.nameTextField.accessibilityLabel = \"Name\"; \\tself.nationalityTextField.accessibilityLabel = \"Nationality\"; \\tself.ageTextField.accessibilityLabel = \"Age\"; \\t \\tself.nameLabel.isAccessibilityElement = false; \\tself.nationalityLabel.isAccessibilityElement = false; \\tself.ageLabel.isAccessibilityElement = false; \\t\\t     }      override func didReceiveMemoryWarning() {         super.didReceiveMemoryWarning()         // Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.     } … } Be  aware that the above is a very simple example, but it highlights how strategic use of the accessibilityLabel and isAccessibilityElement properties can both ensure components are labelled correctly, and can help to reduce the number of swipes per page. Postscript (31st July 2017) Thank you to Ashton Williams who commented that hiding elements from VoiceOver that would otherwise appear to be focusable may be confusing. Indeed, I agree this may confuse sighted users who use VoiceOver. Ashton suggests the following alternative approaches:  Expand the accessibilityFrame of the text field to encapsulate both the label and the text field, which makes them appear as a single focusable element. Group form controls in a TableView, whereby each cell contains a label and a text field that is treated as a single focusable element.     alt in HTML5 – Moving Forward  Posted on Friday, 22 February 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Standards Tag: HTML   As a result of some sage advice from Jason White (a W3C veteran), amongst others. Myself, Laura Carlson and Josh O Connor have started to attend the HTML WG weekly teleconferences. Our first meeting has already yielded some positive progress: Action 54 – draft text for HTML 5 spec to require producers/authors to include @alt on img elements This is an opportunity to provide positive input into the development of the HTML5 specification on an issue that is integral to the accessibility of the majority of non text content available on the web. We would appreciate continued input from the accessibility community to ensure we get it right!

The Google Access team have been working hard to make Chrome more accessible to a range of users. Google Chrome accessibility You can read about the technical details of Chrome keyboard, low vision and screen reader support in the Accessibility Technical Documentation. Suffice to say from a technical view point Chrome is almost up there with Internet Explorer on Windows, but still has a way to go to reach Firefox’s level of accessibility support. On OSX and iOS it’s close to Safari’s level of support.  On Linux Firefox is still the only choice. The technical improvements strongly suggest Chrome is nearing practical support for users with disabilities, but that can only be confirmed by the users themselves. Chrome still has a way to go in regards to HTML and ARIA implementation and improved support for new HTML5 features is required, but the commitment is there and the work is being done. The people responsible deserve congratulations for their efforts to date and the hope is it will continue apace. Like browser development in general, accessibility support involves continuous work. Chrome Frame Chrome Frame pretty much inherits all improvements in HTML and ARIA support found in Chrome. A notable exception is that it does not support Windows High Contrast mode as this is provided in Chrome by a High Contrast extension.

Being able to navigate to any major area of the page quickly and easily is something that sighted mouse users take for granted. The Landmarks extension allows everyone, including keyboard-only users, to discover and navigate landmarks. It has recently been re-worked to run on Firefox, Chrome and Opera, with plans to support Edge in future.  This post is about a new WebExtension—if you want to learn about implementing Landmarks on your site, please refer to Easy content organisation with HTML5, or Using WAI-ARIA Landmarks, which contains additional technical information. Backstory Sighted people can get an overview of page content at a glance. Before landmarks, blind screen reader users relied on headings to get an idea of the content on the page (however, there could be many headings, which would take a long time to read, which often made it hard to get a quick overview). Skip links were the only way to navigate to broad areas, or regions, of content.  They are usually used to allow screen reader and keyboard-only users to jump over any repetitive header and navigation, to the main content, which saves a lot of time. However they do have a drawback: skip links can only be accessed from the places they happen to have been added to the page by the author; they can’t be used to move between broad areas of the page whenever the user wants. Landmark-based navigation solves these problems.  By providing a few landmark “roles” that indicate broad areas of content (e.g. a header, main content, search box), the user is not overwhelmed, and can get a quick overview of the page. These landmarks are already associated with particular HTML elements, so many sites may already be using them. Labels can also be provided, which is useful if there’s more than one of a particular type of landmark region (e.g. you could have site-wide and page-specific navigation links, and label them as such). Unfortunately, mainstream browsers don’t expose landmarks to the user—the only way to access them is to use an assistive technology, such as a screen reader, which will usually provide a dialog that lists page landmarks, as well as shortcut keys for moving between them. Anyone who doesn’t use a screen reader may be unaware of them. People who use the keyboard only (but not a screen reader) in particular are therefore missing out on a feature that could make navigation much quicker. Back in 2012, David Todd from IBM wrote a Firefox extension to allow keyboard users to navigate between landmarks easily—no screen reader required. In 2013 I took up maintenance of this extension, to add support for HTML 5’s native landmarks and to support the latest Firefox version at the time. Since then, there have been a couple of significant developments for the extension and for landmark navigation. Supporting multiple browsers and new features The WebExtension API, originated and popularised by Google Chrome, has become the de facto method for creating add-ons for browsers; it has been adopted by browsers such as Firefox, Opera, Edge, Brave and Vivaldi. Over the past several months, I have re-written much of the Landmarks extension to use this new structure and API so it now runs on Firefox, Chrome and Opera. It has also been tested in Microsoft’s Edge browser (with help from TPG’s Mark Novak), and I’m hoping to have it ready for distribution by the time Edge’s extensions store opens to submissions from all developers. Hopefully this will widen access to landmark navigation to many more people. You can install it on Firefox, Chrome and Opera already. The re-working presented the opportunity to add features such as: automatic discovery of landmarks on the page (with the toolbar button being badged with the number of landmarks found), and the display of a hierarchical list of landmarks on the page when the user activates the extension’s toolbar button. The following figure shows the Landmarks extension’s GitHub page, with the Landmarks pop-up open, and the button for one of the navigation regions activated. The navigation region has been focused and highlighted.  As part of the conversion to being a WebExtension, the code has also been modularised, and code quality tools ESLint and EditorConfig are used, as well as Travis CI to independently verify the code builds (and tests, described below, run) successfully. Validity, tests and the specifications I have added a test suite to verify that the extension follows the spec, and that landmarks are correctly reported. The code has also been updated in line with the latest ARIA 1.1 changes (e.g. application is no longer a landmark role). During this process, it became apparent that in some cases, assistive technologies’ interpretations of landmarks differ slightly from that of the specification. For example, they will often disregard <form> elements without associated labels, as these have historically been used in abundance on pages (often for technical reasons). Having too many landmarks dilutes their usefulness—they are intended to provide a high-level overview (whereas headings are intended to provide more fine-grained navigation within an area of the page). If you would like some detailed technical information, and to get a glimpse of how the relevant specs are developed, here are links to two of the issues discussed, regarding: unlabelled region landmarks and unlabelled <form> elements. Going through this process has improved the extension’s accuracy, and taught me a great deal about the specs and the contribution process. The people who develop the specifications are open to contributions, and deal with them constructively, so I would urge anyone considering reporting an issue, or proposing a change, to give it a go. Download Install the Landmarks Extension on Firefox, Chrome and/or Opera. (The extension was recently submitted to Opera for consideration, so will be available soon.) Summary The Landmarks extension has been re-tooled to work on a range of modern browsers (with support for Edge an aspiration for the near future). Thanks again to David Todd for creating the extension in the first place, to The Paciello Group for donating development time to this open-source project, to Steve Faulkner for suggesting I create some patches for it, and to Mark Novak for helping me test it. Support for Landmarks is provided as and when I am able; if you find any issues with it, please report these via the Landmarks GitHub page.  WCAG 2.0 Parsing Criterion is a PITA  Posted on Friday, 20 November 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: StandardsCategory: Testing   Any change in WCAG 2.1? Nope, 2.1 parsing criterion is still a PITA The WCAG 2.0 Parsing Criterion is a Pain In The Ass (PITA) because the checking of it throws up lots of potential errors that if required to fix, may result in a lot of extra work (in some cases busy work) for developers. This is largely due to the lack of robust tools for producing a set of specific issues that require fixing. I have discussed the parsing criterion previously in WCAG 2.0 parsing error bookmarklet also providing a bookmarklet that helps to filter out some HTML conformance checker errors that are definitely (maybe) not potential accessibility issues. IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not saying here that checking and fixing HTML Conformance errors is not an important and useful part of web development process, only that fixing all HTML conformance errors is not a requirement for accessibility. There are good reasons to validate your HTML as part of the development process. What the WCAG parsing criterion requires? Is really, only, a very limited subset of the errors and warnings that may be produced when checking with the only available tools (i.e. HTML conformance checkers) for testing the WCAG parsing Criterion. You can use a HTML conformance checker to find such errors, but the errors that need fixing for accessibility purposes can often be needles in a haystack. 1. Complete start and end tags note: but only when this is required by the specification Examples of what happens: This: fieldset><input></fieldset> Displays this on page: fieldset> or This: <img src=\"HTML5_Logo.png\" alt=\"HTML5\"\\r <p>test</p> Produces this in DOM: <img <p=\"\" alt=\"HTML5\" src=\"HTML5_Logo.png\"> test\\r <p></p> i.e. unintended empty p element with intended text not contained and a mutant attribute <p=\"\" sprouted on the img element. What this requirement does not mean Adding end tags to every element:  <input></input> ... <li>list item </li> ... or self closing elements without end tags  <input /> <img /> There are rules in HTML detailing which elements require end tags and under what circumstances:  Optional Tags. You can also find this information under Tag omission in text/html in the definition of each element in HTML. 4.5.9 The abbr element … Tag omission in text/html: Neither tag is omissible http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/text-level-semantics.html#the-abbr-element  Good news is that most code errors of this type will be fairly obvious as they will show up as text strings in the rendered code or effect style/positioning of content and produce funky attributes in the DOM. 2. Malformed attribute and attribute values quoted attributes Any attributes that take text strings or a set of space-separated tokens or a set of comma-separated tokens or a valid list of integers, need to be quoted: Do this: <p class=\"poot pooter\">some text about poot</p>\\r <img alt=\"The Etiology of poot.\" src=\"poot.png\"> Not this: //missing end quote on class attribute with multiple values: \\r <p class=\"poot pooter>some text about poot</p>\\r \\r //no quotes on class attribute with multiple values: \\r <p class=poot pooter>some text about poot</p>\\r \\r //missing start quote on alt attribute\\r <img alt=The Etiology of poot.\" src=\"poot.png\">\\r \\r //no quotes on alt attribute\\r <img alt=The Etiology of poot. src=\"poot.png\"> Note: although some attributes do not require quoted values, the safest and sanest thing to do is quote all attributes. Spaces between attributes Do this: <p class=\"poot\" id=\"pooter\">some text about poot</p>\\r <img alt=\"The Etiology of poot.\" src=\"poot.png\"> Not this: //no space between class and id attributes: \\r <p class=\"poot\"id=\"pooter\">some text about poot</p>\\r \\r //no space between alt and src attributes:\\r <img alt=\"The Etiology of poot.\"src=\"poot.png\"> Further reading on attributes: Failure of Success Criterion 4.1.1 due to incorrect use of start and end tags or attribute markup 3. Elements are nested according to their specifications What this requirement means is that you cannot do something silly like having a list item li without it having a ul or ol as a parent: <div>\\r <li>list item</li>  <li>list item</li> </div> or multiple controls inside a label element: <label>\\r first name <input type=\"text\">  last name <input type=\"text\"> </label> Examples of what happens: For “a list item li without it having a ul or ol as a parent” depending on browser, the semantics of the list item including  the role, list size and position of an item in the list, are lost. It also results in funky rendering across browsers. For “multiple controls inside a label element” depending on the browser, the accessible name for each of the controls is a concatenation of the text inside the label, so in the example case, each control has an accessible name of “first name last name”. Also clicking, with the mouse, on either text label will move focus to the first control in the label element. 4. Elements do not contain duplicate attributes Pretty simple, don’t do this: <img alt=\"html5\"  alt=\"html6\"> Note: although this is a requirement in the WCAG criteria and a HTML conformance requirement, it causes no harm accessibility wise unless the 2nd instance of the duplicate attribute is one that exposes  required information, the usual processing behaviour for duplicate attributes is that the first instance is used, further instances are ignored. 5. Any IDs are unique Again, pretty simple, don’t do this <body>\\r ...\\r <p id=\"IAmUnique\">\\r ...\\r  <div  id=\"IAmUnique\"> \\r ... \\r </body>\\r  Note: although this is a requirement in the WCAG criteria and a HTML conformance requirement, it causes no harm accessibility wise unless the id value is being referenced by a relationship attribute such as for or headers or aria-labelledby etc. Some further examples of HTML conformance errors that ARE NOT WCAG parsing criterion fails  Unrecognized attributes: Error: Attribute event not allowed on element a at this point.  Unrecognized Elements: Error: Element poot not allowed as child of element body in this context.  Bad attribute values: Error: Bad value grunt for attribute type on element input.  Missing attribute values: Error: Element meta is missing one or more of the following attributes: content, property.  Obsolete elements and attributes: Error: The align attribute on the td element is obsolete.

Posted on Thursday, 10 December 2015 by Léonie Watson  Category: Development Tag: SVGTag: WCAG   A recent question prompted me to ask whether the SVG <text> element would pass WCAG 2.0 1.4.5 (images of text).  WCAG Success Criterion (SC) 1.4.5 says: If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text The following exceptions are noted:   Customizable: The image of text can be visually customized to the user’s requirements; Essential: A particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed.   The reason for this SC is that when text is presented in graphical format it has the following problems:  It can’t be accessed directly by assistive technologies; It can’t be displayed using colours specified in the browser, or through a user’s personalised style sheets; It can’t be resized using the browser’s settings.  SVG is a graphical format, so when the <text> element is used it seems like it should qualify as text in an image. For example:  <svg version=\"1.1\" width=\"150\" height=\"100\"> <text>Tequila!</text> </svg>  As far as the platform accessibility APIs are concerned, this isn’t the case though. The SVG <text> element is exposed as text content by APIs including IAccessible2, UIAutomation and MSAA. This means assistive technologies like screen readers can access the text directly. Like all SVG content, the <text> element can be styled using CSS. This means that the information in WCAG technique C22 is helpful when using <text> in SVG. Providing the separation of style and content is observed, SVG <text> can be displayed according to choices made through browser settings or personalised style sheets. Another characteristic of SVG is that it scales. This means that SVG <text> can be resized using the browsers text resize settings, and that the size of text will scale depending on the size of the browser window. So my take is that the SVG <text> element should pass WCAG SC1.4.5. In many respects <text> behaves more like text than graphical content, and it can be resized, selected and copied and displayed according to someone’s personal preferences. It’s an interesting question though, and there may be degrees of subtlety I haven’t considered in these notes! With thanks to Steve Faulkner for help confirming these findings.  HTML5 canvas accessibility discussions 2009-2011  Posted on Thursday, 1 December 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Charles Pritchard has taken the time to provide an email overview of Canvas accessibility discussions which have taken place on the public-canvas-api over the past 3 years. I have reformatted it here and added some headings, as it is an excellent resource for understanding where we have been and where we are with HTML5 canvas accessibility:  The Canvas API mailing list This list is intended to serve as a dedicated thread for matters  specific to the Canvas API and its intersection with other DOM  interfaces and with markup. The bulk of the work the past three years has been in advocating for  accessibility frameworks. There has been exhaustive discussion with  developers from several browser vendors, stemming from an early  recommendation that the Canvas sub-tree be supported. All accessibility frameworks are dependent on the ability to have an  object model to provides a hierarchy that provides context to a user and  which can provide interfaces to an assistive technology [for example] a  2D chart has dynamically changing data it could be replaced with an HTML  table marked asa live region or even a grid.” Accessibility remains unresolved Programmatic access is a conformance principle of the Web Content  Accessibility Guidelines.  Accessibility remains unresolved and an issue in last call procedures for HTML5 as of December 2011: “There are numerous accessibility issues/bugs that will need to be  addressed, before the spec. leaves last call”  Concerns and unaddressed issues for the HTML 5 specifications Status of Canvas A11y Bug Reports  3 years on Work on resolving Canvas accessibility issues took shape in July 2009. It has been decided to form a task force to work on specifying  additions to the CANVAS API, that will result in canvas content being  natively accessible. The merits of supporting Canvas and DOM tree interaction were discussed  in a late 2009 accessibility call. [Supporting] focus for ‘widgets’ inside the canvas could also be  handled via DOM, by adding a requirement that anything inside the  canvas’s DOM subtree with a tabindex must still participate in the tab  cycle and produce focus events Canvas element  sub-tree support Microsoft added support for focus events inside the Canvas element  sub-tree in their release of IE9. Other vendors are expected to follow  suit. WebKit reviewed but eventually rejected an early patch in February  2011. [Do not use RenderReplaced,] the best way to fix it is to make  RenderHTMLCanvas a RenderBlock and more like a form control Focus ring support drawFocusRing, a new Canvas Context 2d method, was added to the  specification. It’s purpose to display a focus box within the canvas  element when focus events are received. Currently, no vendors support the drawFocusRing method, though there is  broad consensus that it should be supported.    Mozilla has been discussing support for some time. Their bug report follows the whatwg specification, which recommends two methods:  drawSystemFocusRing(element) and drawCustomFocusRing(element) whereas  the w3c specification recommends one method with an optional boolean  attribute: drawFocusRing(element, boolean).  The drawFocusRing method was chosen over <map> element / useMap extensions proposed in early 2010.  drawFocusRing demonstrates that the Canvas sub-tree is available for  focus management and that the Canvas 2d path API is being exposed, in  some manner to the system accessibility API. It’s an important  milestone. Canvas clickable regions The various issues that have been discussed are catalogued on  a W3C wiki page.  There is consensus that the useMap property, based on HTML4 <map>,  should not be used with Canvas. The competing focus ring and caret  tracking proposals were moved forward.  Unfortunately, the group has had mixed consensus about approaching  clickable regions in Canvas.  We’ve not been able to develop broad consensus. Many spec editors and  developers who work for [browser] vendors have suggested that use cases involving  interactive elements are not appropriate uses of HTML5 and should not be  encouraged. There has been strong push-back suggesting that Canvas not  be used for such cases and that SVG be used. [In cases where] you only have a few active regions, then you probably  only have a few shapes, and you can use SVG Just use SVG This lead to a lengthy series of threads about the pros and cons of SVG and Canvas development and the repeated suggestion that interactive  regions in Canvas should not be encouraged (nor supported) by [browser] vendors,  as they are better suited by retained vectors in SVG. You are attempting to recreate a retained-mode API in an immediate-mode  API. Why is ‘use SVG’ not sufficient for this? Many developers who work for [browser] vendors have simply said that SVG should be  used instead of Canvas for interactive applications. The HTML5 editor has repeatedly suggested that interactive elements not be allowed within  the Canvas sub-tree. The HTML5 has repeatedly specified that button and  checkbox, anchor and radio be the only widget types allowed in the  Canvas sub-tree. These specification changes were reverted in respect  for W3C procedure. Note, the restriction is still present in the WHATWG  specification. Transparent, but with no interactive content descendants except for a  elements, button elements, input elements whose type attribute are in  the Checkbox or Radio Button states, and input elements that are buttons. Use of CSS overlays Canvas developers rarely use CSS overlays to handle focus management and  other interactivity. This is likely because of the difficult management  of z-index ordering as well as the manual computation of bounding boxes.  This difficulty is avoided with the drawFocusRing method of Canvas 2d,  but no vendors currently support the method, and so CSS overlays are the  only real-world practice available today (December 2011).  There are now multiple proposals for enabling clickable regions through  the use of the Canvas sub-tree, DOM events, and new methods to the  Canvas Context 2d API. Other participants in the working group have  gone forward with attempting to support more complex widget types. Proposals: 2 simple examples These proposals, as envisioned can be expressed by two simple examples,  both of them forward events into the Canvas sub-tree to bubble up the  DOM in standard fashion.  ( setDrawingFor proposal ): beginElement(elem1); … drawing operations here … endElement();   This proposal captures paths when fill*() and drawImage calls are made,  starting from the time beginElement is called, and binding those paths  to the target element in the Canvas sub-tree.  (setClickableRegion proposal) beginPath(); … drawing operations here … setClickableRegion(element);   Like drawFocusRing, the setClickableRegion proposal only uses the  current path in the Canvas state, and binds that path to the target  element. Both of the methods are shown in the context of the input  type=checkbox demonstration:Canvas 2d Pointer Checkbox   Other strong disagreements: the W3C and WHATWG specifications remain divided Outside of this active proposal there exist strong disagreements about  text handling, whether it be rich text editing or reporting on the caret  position and selection. The group has yet to build wide consensus that  Canvas widgets are and will be regular staples of web application  deployments. As such, most of the existing demonstrations of Canvas  applications have not been accepted as Canvas use cases.  It’s consistent to argue that HTML5 should prohibit the use of “canvas”  to create text editors.  New developments, such as Mozilla’s PDF.js and the W3C Chair decision to  include caret tracking have loosened some of these positions against  Canvas-based complex widgets. Still, the WHATWG and W3C specifications  remain divided as does the consensus of this working group. Lack of progress: hindering accessibility The lack of  progress, and the bulk of thread-traffic on this list has been related  to a fundamental disagreement about the scope of the Canvas element and  the public-canvas-api list. Should Canvas-based ARIA widgets be supported? Complex Canvas-based  widgets are being authored. There are many examples on the web today.  These examples work, but they are not [generally] programmatically  accessible: testing and automation tools as well as assistive  technologies are not granted exposure to the values they need to work.  This is, at times, a self-imposed limitation of the developer, having  used HTML5 Canvas instead of HTML4 and/or SVG. But, these are also  limitations imposed by developers who work for vendors, having decided  that they will not support Canvas accessibility on principal and in  practice. Where developers have jumped in, head-first, putting money and resources  into Canvas-based user interfaces, vendors have a responsibility to  their users. Though there are many reasonable arguments as to why  authors should use SVG, those arguments do little to support users who  are trying to access Canvas-based interfaces. Those users are excluded.  The bar is simply set to high for most authors to support them. Several  proposals have been put out in order to lower that bar. There remains a  fundamental disagreement about whether or not the problem should be  fixed — about whether there is an accessibility problem.  At present, there are only minor disagreements in how to fix the problem.  HTML5Accessibility.com updated  Posted on Wednesday, 12 March 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Since October 2010 I have been testing and recording information on HTML5Accessibility.com about the implementation of accessibility support in browsers for new HTML5 features. I had let the updates to the site slide, but have made a concerted effort in 2014 to provide the information on the latest browsers. For now only windows browsers are covered. Support information for Mac browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox) will be coming soon. Overview of HTML5 accessibility support in Windows browsers HTML5 Accessibility Support Score   88.5/100  +  47/100  37/100 Firefox  have consistently lead the pack in providing accessibility support for new features as they are implemented. This is a great achievement by the Mozilla Accessibility Engineers and really important work, as it allows user with disabilities, who require assistive technology to participate on the web, the opportunity to do so. Chrome (+Opera) and Internet Explorer continue to perform poorly in implementing accessibility support. Chrome has many unfinished/partial implementations, while Internet Explorer is particularly poor in providing accessibility support for non interactive HTML elements. Browser implementation bugs have been filed where applicable and are listed in the ‘notes’ column of the HTML5 accessibility support tables. Detailed accessibility support information is available at HTML5Accessibility.com  Using the HTML title attribute – updated  Posted on Tuesday, 15 January 2013 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   tl;dr If you want to hide content from mobile and tablet users as well as assistive tech users and keyboard only users, use the title attribute. The details The HTML title attribute is problematic. It is problematic because it is not well supported in some crucial respects, even though it has been with us for over 14 years. With the rise of touch screen interfaces, the usefulness of this attribute has decreased. The accessibility of the title attribute has fallen victim to a unfortunate combination of poor browser support, poor screen reader support and poor authoring practices. Situations in which the the title attribute is not useful due to lack of support:  Displaying information for web content viewed on mobile phone browsers. Typically in desktop browsers title attribute content is displayed as a tooltip. From what I could find, tooltip display is not supported in any mobile browser and alternative visual methods of accessing title attribute content are not supported. Providing information for people who cannot use a mouse. Typically in desktop browsers, title attribute content is displayed as a tooltip. Although the tooltip behaviour has been supported for 10+ years, no browser (except IE10+ [on focusable elements]) as yet has implemented a practical method to display title attribute content using the keyboard. Using it on most HTML elements to provide information for users of a variety of assistive technologies. Access to title attribute information is not supported uniformly by screen readers  User groups not well served by use of the title attribute  Mobile phone users. Keyboard only users. Screen magnifier users. Screen reader users. Users with fine motor skill impairments. Users with cognitive impairments  Examples of title attribute use that are USEFUL:  Labelling frame or iframe elements:  <frame title=\"navigation\">   Providing a programmatically associated label for a control in situations where a visible text label would be redundant:  <input type=\"text\" title=\"search\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"search\"> labelling controls in data tables.    Examples of title attribute use that are NOT USEFUL or are of LIMITED USE:  For additional information not provided as text in a link or surrounding content:  <a href=\"newsletter.PDF\" title=\"PDF file, size 1 mb.\">newsletter</a> Instead include such information as part of the link text or next to the link.   Providing the same information provided as link text:  <a href=\"newsletter.PDF\" title=\"newsletter\">newsletter</a> Recommend not duplicating content of a link in the title attribute. It does nothing and makes it less likely if people can access title attribute content that they will do so.   For a caption on an image:  <img src=\"castle1858.jpeg\" title=\"Oil-based paint on canvas. Maria Towle, 1858.\" alt=\"The castle now has two towers and two walls.\"> Presumably caption information is important information that should be available to all users by default. If so present this content as text next to the image.   For a label on a control that has no visible text label:  <input type=\"text\" title=\"name\"> Screen readers users will have access to the control label, as the title attribute is mapped to the accessible name property in accessibility APIs (when a text label using the label element is not supplied ). Many other users will not. Recommend including a visible text label whenever possible.   Providing the same information as a visible explicitly associated text label for a control:  <label for=\"n1\">name</label> <input type=\"text\" title=\"name\" id=\"n1\"> Repeating the visible label text does nothing except possibly add cognitive noise for a range of users. Do not do it.   Providing additional instructions for a control:  <label for=\"n1\">name</label> <input type=\"text\" title=\"Please use uppercase.\" id=\"n1\"> If the instructions are important for using the control correctly, then provide them in text near the control, so they can be read by everyone.   Expansion of an abbreviation:  <abbr title=\"world wide web consortium\">W3C</abbr> The title on the abbr element is well supported by screen reader software, but its use is still problematic, as other user groups cannot access the expansion. It is recommended that the expanded form of an abbreviation is provided in plain text when it is first used in a document, and/or a glossary of terms that provides the expanded form is provided. This is not to suggest that that the expansion should not be provided using the title attribute, only that due to its limitations, an expansion in plain text should also be provided.    The HTML5 Recommendation includes this warning on use of the title attribute: Relying on the title attribute for the visual display of text content is currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by this specification (e.g. requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to appear, which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or tablet). source: HTML5 – the title attribute Further Reading  title attribute use and abuse The title attribute – what is it good for? (resurrected) Too much accessibility – TITLE attributes   HTML5 Accessibility Chops: the placeholder attribute  Posted on Friday, 18 February 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   The placeholder attribute: The placeholder attribute can be used to place text inside an empty input type=\"text\" or textarea, the text is removed when the element receives focus. Placeholder browser accessibility support tests updated: 31/10/2013 What the HTML5 specification says: The placeholder attribute represents a short hint (a word or short phrase) intended to aid the user with data entry. The placeholder attribute should not be used as an alternative to a label. HTML code example: <label>Address: <input type=\"email\" name=\"address\" placeholder=\"john@example.net\"></label> Default Display Example:  Accessibility Issues? Placeholder text colour The default colour of the placeholder text, in browsers that support placeholder, is not of sufficient contrast with its default background colour. Sufficiency is measured using the WCAG 2.0 criteria 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. There are a number of tools you can use to check contrast ratio. Recommendations: If you choose to use the placeholder attribute be aware its support across browsers is incomplete and its styling support is still experimental. Apply a style to the placeholder attribute text that has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. CSS code example: To target the placeholder text  it is currently required that browser specific CSS extensions are used: input::-webkit-input-placeholder {     color:    #626262; } input::-moz-placeholder {     color:    #626262; }  Placeholder as an alternative to a label HTML code example: <input type=\"email\" name=\"address\" placeholder=\"address\"> Placeholder text disappears when a text box receives focus:  For keyboard users this can be problematic as they must read ahead of current focus when filling in forms. Users, especially those with memory impairments will not have the text label available for reference at the same time as filling in a field.  Other issues with placeholders  Users may think a text field is already filled in and skip over it. Data suggests that this can be an issue. If the placeholder hint text is useful information it should be available while the user is filling in the field.  Recommendations: Use placeholder for what it is intended for, not what the HTML5 conformance criteria permits. The HTML5 specification says “placeholder should not be used as an alternative to a label.” But it stops short of saying it MUST NOT be used, so it is conforming to use it as an alternative in HTML5 and will be used as a label. To this end  browsers are using the content of the placeholder attribute, in the absence of a label, as the accessible name exposed to accessibility APIs. This does not mean that that it should be used as a text field label. Always provide an explicitly associated text label for a text field, using either the label element or the title attribute. Use placeholder for what it is intended for, not what the HTML5 conformance criteria permits. HTML code examples: <label>Address: <input type=\"email\" name=\"address\" placeholder=\"john@example.net\"></label>  <label for=\"address\">Address: </label> <input type=\"email\" name=\"address\" id=\"address\" placeholder=\"john@example.net\">  <input type=\"text\" title=\"search\"  placeholder=\"enter search term\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"search\">  HTML5 Accessibility Challenges  Posted on Friday, 28 January 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   It has been claimed that HTML5 will do a lot to improve the accessibility of web content and web based applications. In theory this is true. The introduction of new form controls in HTML5 is promising, because developers will have to do less bolting on of accessibility information themselves, as it will hopefully have been bolted on by the browser vendors.  The current accessibility support implemented in browsers lags behind their implementations of the sexy new features themselves. These are still early days in the implementation of HTML5 features, so lets keep our fingers crossed that Google,  Apple (Safari on Windows) and Opera will get their acts together to provide at least a basic level  of HTML support in their browsers for assistive technology users. Equally it is hoped  Mozilla, Apple (Safari on Mac) and Microsoft will strive to have their rate of accessibility support match their rapid implementation of the new HTML5 features. Information about accessibility support for implemented HTML5 features is available at www.HTML5accessibility.com. The challenge further extends to standardizing the implementation of accessibility features. To this end some people including myself have started work on a document at the W3C called the HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide (early draft). An issue that the implementation guide is being designed to help avoid is differences between browsers about how and what information they convey to users of assistive technology. For example, Firefox and Webkit currently have differing ways of providing labels for form controls when using text from the HTML5 placeholder attribute, this divergence will cause issues for both users and authors as there is no clear way to provide a text label that will be uniformly presented to users regardless of browser.  As a consequence it is planned to include information in the implementation guide on what and how to use the content of elements and attributes to provide text labels. Details of the current Firefox and Webkit form control labeling issues:   HTML5 placeholder attribute tests  The title attribute – what is it good for? (resurrected)  Posted on Tuesday, 12 February 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTMLTag: JAWS   While working at vision australia I presented at Web Essentials 05 on the HTML title attribute, which lead to a right royal fisking by Joe Clark. I also conducted research on screen reader support and how it (title attribute) was accessed by user’s. These documents became unavailable due to hosting issues.

Posted on Friday, 23 September 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Back in 2009 I wrote Google Chrome Frame – accessibility black hole, now 2 years on what has changed? This quick revisit has been prompted by some recent tweets.  Refer to Google Chrome accessibility update  Chrome Frame 14 accessibility support As I said this a quick revisit, so will get straight to the point. It is my understanding that Chrome Frame development tracks the chrome browser, including accessibility support. Chrome and hence Chrome Frame does not support labelling of form controls using standard HTML methods. Note: older versions of Internet Explorer and current versions of Safari only support the for/id method. The chrome team are working on accessibility issues. There are still quite a few other issues such as lack of support for Windows High Contrast mode. I believe the lack of support for form control labelling alone is a showstopper. The chrome team are aware of the issue, lets hope it gets fixed soon. Check out HTML5Accessibility.com for browser accessibility support issues with new HTML5 features. So while Chrome/Chrome Frame is no longer an accessibility black hole, it is still akin to looking through a glass darkly, for some. Addendum Great to read about accessibility improvements in Chrome 15!  HTML5 Canvas Accessibility in Firefox 13  Posted on Wednesday, 6 June 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The recently released Firefox 13 implements the HTML5 specification’s canvas element fallback concept. This means that the content inside a canvas elements start and end tags is exposed to assistive technology users even when the browser supports canvas. It also means that any interactive elements, inside a canvas elements start and end tags such as links or form controls will be included in a documents default tab order even when the browser supports canvas.  Canvas in Firefox 13 has a navigable sub DOM The HTML specification states: When a canvas element represents embedded content, the user can still focus descendants of the canvas element (in the fallback content). When an element is focused, it is the target of keyboard interaction events (even though the element itself is not visible). This allows authors to make an interactive canvas keyboard-accessible: authors should have a one-to-one mapping of interactive regions to focusable elements in the fallback content. (Focus has no effect on mouse interaction events.) Which translates as meaning the content inside a canvas element: If interactive, should be included in the tab order and operable with the keyboard. All content is accessible to assistive technology such as screen readers. So in the canvas example, the text alternative should be announced by screen readers and the links are navigable and operable using the keyboard. Until now, this behaviour had only been implemented in Internet Explorer 9, but with the release of Firefox 13, there are now 2 browsers that  implement support as per the HTML5 specification. So if you are using Firefox 13 or IE9 with the keyboard to navigate interactive elements, you can tab to the links in the canvas example. If you are using a screen reader, you can also access the text alternative (in this case) content inside the canvas element. Canvas example with a text alternative and interactive elements (links) inside the canvas element. Canvas example HTML code: <canvas id=\"example\" width=\"260\" height=\"200\"> <h2>Shapes</h2> <p>A rectangle with a black border. In the background is a pink circle. Partially overlaying the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle\" onfocus=\"drawCircle();\" onblur=\"drawPicture();\">circle</a>. Partially overlaying the circle is a green <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square\" onfocus=\"drawSquare();\" onblur=\"drawPicture();\">square</a> and a purple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle\" onfocus=\"drawTriangle();\" onblur=\"drawPicture();\">triangle</a>, both of which are semi-opaque, so the full circle can be seen underneath.</p> </canvas> NVDA announces Canvas sub DOM content (from example page): “Shapes heading  level 2 A rectangle with a black border. In the background is a pink circle. Partially overlaying the visited  link circle. Partially overlaying the circle is a green visited  link square and a purple visited  link triangle, both of which are semi-opaque, so the full circle can be seen underneath.” Video demo’s:  NVDA reading canvas sub-DOM content in Firefox 13 ZoomText reading canvas sub-DOM content in Firefox 13  Some Potential Issues  Where content is currently included in canvas, it is almost exclusively of the “get a better browser that supports canvas” variety, so screen reader users will encounter this when using Firefox 13 or IE9. Authors will most likely continue to provide useless information (for screen reader users) as the general definition of “fallback content” in the HTML5 specification is at odds with how canvas content is presented to keyboard and AT users in browsers that support the canvas element and at odds with how the term is used in reference to other embedded content elements where the fallback content is ONLY available to users if the prmary content is not supported. Keyboard focus is lost if interactive elements are included inside the canvas, because while elements inside the canvas element are focusable by default, there is no corresponding default indication of focus to identify where current focus is. This means that developers must provide pseudo focus rings that are displayed when an interactive element in the canvas sub DOM receives focus, an example of this is provided triggered by inline (for demo purposes only) onfocus/onblur event handlers. There is a proposal for dedicated canvas API methods for the display of focus rings, but these have not yet been agreed upon or implemented.  Developers Be(a)ware In Firefox 13+ and IE 9+ HTML content inside the canvas element is now available at all times to assistive technology users and keyboard users can operate links and controls and they are included in the default tab order. So please provide alternatives to on screen canvas content and interactivity in the canvas sub DOM. DO NOT include a dumb message telling the user that they need to get a browser that supports canvas! HTML5 definition of ‘fallback content‘ Some embedded content elements can have fallback content: content that is to be used when the external resource cannot be used (e.g. because it is of an unsupported format). The element definitions state what the fallback is, if any. This general definition of fallback content is problematic, because in the case of canvas and how its use pertains to assistive technology and keyboard users. In Firefox 13 and IE 9 the canvas element is supported, so the content in the sub DOM is not fallback. The example I provided could  have had hit testing on the shapes drawn on the canvas so that a click event could be passed to the links in the sub DOM. The use of the term ‘fallback’ for the contents of the sub DOM helps to mislead developers about sub DOM use. An example of erroneous information is provided in the video: HTML5 Canvas Fallback Content Tutorial  Web Accessibility Toolbar 2011 – Updated  Posted on Wednesday, 29 June 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   We have been working on bug fixes to the Web Accessibility Toolbar 2011, the update is now available for download, includes the latest version of aViewer. In honour of Jim Thatcher’s important and continuing contribution to making the web a more accessible medium, I have worked on an update to the Web Accessibility Toolbar for Internet Explorer, which includes new features that he has developed. Today At CSUN 2011, Jim Thatcher is being presented with a life time achievement award. Here at TPG we join the many others in the Accessibility Community that wish to thank Jim for his continuing leadership, insight and guidance on web accessibility. Jim has been a supporter of the Web Accessibility Toolbar since its initial release back in 2004. Of late, I have not had the time to work on developing the WAT. Jim emailed me last year with some scripts he had developed that provide additional features for checking web content. I had not incorporated these new features into the WAT, but thought the honouring of Jim at this years CSUN as the perfect excuse to pull my finger out and release an update. Its a leaner version than WAT 2.0, I have removed outdated, obsolete or buggy features, and added some new stuff.

Developer Beware: Using Flash to Detect Screen Readers  Posted on Monday, 28 April 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: JAWS   The facility to detect some Assistive Technology by using Flash has been around since ActionScript 1.0 and Flash Player 6. The method has usually been referred to as a way to ‘detect screen readers’. Unfortunately this method, using the ActionScript Accessibility.isActive method, is not a ‘screen reader’ detector. The Accessibility.isActive method documentation is quite clear on this Indicates whether an accessibility aid is currently active and the player is communicating with it. Use this method when you want your application to behave differently in the presence of a screen reader or other accessibility aid. What it actually detects is the presence of software that is accessing accessible information via the Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) API. Assistive Technology that makes use of MSAA includes, but is not limited to, JAWS and Window Eyes screen readers, Zoomtext and Magic magnifiers and Dragon Naturally Speaking text to speech software. There is currently no method available to detect what type of software is being used, only that it makes use of MSAA. It is obvious that alternative content, which may be appropriate for screen reader usersÂ could reduce the accessibility for magnifier or text to speech software users, who have different content view and interaction requirements. Furthermore, this method works on Internet Explorer and Firefox under Windows, but any Assistive Technology that is not being used on Windows or not using MSAA, or the user is browsing with browsers other than IE and Firefox, will not be detected. Problematic use – an example: A recent use of “screen reader” detection that I encountered illustrates the dangers and limitations of this method: A Flash based interactive video makes use of “screen reader” detection to provide an alternative interface and content to screen reader users. The regular version includes an audio track, whereas the “screen reader” version removes the audio track and replaces it with a hidden text stream. If a screen reader\\x9d is detected, the user is presented with a message informing them that if they want to use the version with audio, they need to close the current page, turn off their assistive technology and re-open the page. This means that users must turn off the software they require to access the page in the first place. Andrew Kirkpatrick on the use of Accessibility.isActive I talked with Andrew Kirkpatrick, Senior Product Manager, Accessibility for Adobe Systems about the use of this method, here is what he had to say: “It is accurate to say that a Flash application can detect when an MSAA-using screen reader is running, but the Flash application won’t know if the isActive flag is set by a screen reader or other assistive technology or even by an MSAA testing tool. Developers may still make effective use of the ability to detect potential screen reader use and to offer choices to users. Adobe’s goal is to provide developers the ability to author one version of an application that works for all users rather than resorting to specialized experiences for separate audiences.” So, while isactive has the potential to be useful in providing choices to users, it must be used with caution. Don’t make assumptions about users based on the isactive flag. Provide extra options, but do not remove options, which can force users to jump through hoops to avoid an inferior experience.

You can wrap the control inside the label element or you can include the for attribute on the label element, which has a value matching the id value of the control it is intended to label. What the HTML5 specification says The label represents a caption in a user interface. The caption can be associated with a specific form control, known as the label element’s labeled control, either using for attribute, or by putting the form control inside the label element itself. What it means: Control labeled using for and id <label for=\"tex\">label</label> <input name=\"input\" type=\"text\" id=\"tex\"> Control inside the label  <label>label wrapped <input type=\"text\"></label> Control labeled using for & id and inside the label  <label for=\"a2\">label wrapped and for/id <input type=\"text\" id=\"a2\"> with text before and after input</label> HTML5 Differences to HTML 4.01 These labelling methods are not new to HTML5, they are the same as in HTML 4.0. One difference to note is that in HTML 4 you could assign multiple label elements to a control: More than one LABEL may be associated with the same control by creating multiple references via the for attribute. This does not appear to be the case in HTML5, while not explicitly forbidden, it is not mentioned that it is allowed. It should also be noted that neither browsers or assistive technology (AT)  have provided robust support for multiple labels. Current accessibility support for form control labeling in browsers and AT I ran some tests and found that a control labeled using for and id without placing the control inside the label element is by far the most robust method. I also found use of aria-labelledby is more robust across browsers and AT than the standard HTML method of placing a control inside the label. Complete test and results: Testing form control labelling support in popular browsers and screen readers Advice for developers Assuming the testing is accurate: Until browser implementers fix their accessibility support, if you want controls to be understandable to AT users label controls using for and id. Do not use the control inside the label method. Do not use a combination of the 2 methods. Advice for Browser and AT implementers Assuming the testing is accurate:  Chrome: Implement accessibility support for for/id and label element wrapping. (filed a bug) Safari: Implement accessibility support for label element wrapping. (emailed bug report) Firefox: fix the issue with duplication of label content when for/id and wrapped combination is used. (filed bug) NVDA: fix the issue of label repetition when a control is inside a label.(filed bug)  Advice to self Spend more time working on the HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 so that how this accessibility stuff should and does work is specified somewhere.  Easy content organisation with HTML5  Posted on Thursday, 24 September 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   Typically designers and web developers divide web pages into macro content areas (let’s call them regions). Doing an image search for typical web page returns lots of examples of diagrammatic representations of web pages with similar regions delineated:  header navigation main content sidebar footer  All of the page content is organised into a small number of regions which are parents of the rest of the page content. Usually these regions are identifiable visually by design and the type of content they contain, a user can scan the page and quickly get a feel for the page content and find what they are looking for. With HTML5 you can express this visual organisation semantically in your code. By using just 5 elements (aside, footer, header, main and nav)  available in HTML5 you can provide the understanding and navigation benefits of content organisation to users who would otherwise not be able to perceive it from the visual cues alone: Page layout with header at top, nav on right side, main in the middle, aside on right side and footer at bottom. Code example  <header></header> <nav></nav> <main><main> <aside></aside> <footer></footer>  Region order The order in which the elements are organised and the region types used is based on your content organisation. Hell, if your content is organised such that you have a fat footer at the top of the page and navigation at the bottom, then so be it. Page layout with a fat footer at the top, followed by the main content and navigation at the bottom. Code example  <footer></footer> <main><main> <nav></nav>  Regions within Regions If you content organisation is such that a region is nested within another region, go for it. Page with navigation within the header region Code example  <header> <nav></nav> </header> <main><main> <aside></aside> <footer></footer>  That’s it! When it comes to using HTML5 structural elements to define page regions the semantic magic is done by the browser (mapping the elements to ARIA landmark roles). There are a few general rules that will help users get the most out of your semantic markup:  Ensure all page content is within a region. Less is more, regions are macro structures, so use them parsimoniously. As their number increases their utility to users decreases. To mark up more granular content, within regions, use article/section/headings/paragraphs/lists etc.   aViewer beta – updated  Posted on Tuesday, 28 June 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Refer to: aViewer 2013  CSS, HTML, ARIA,  browsers, assistive technology and interoperability  Posted on Monday, 17 October 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   A number of issues are being debated in accessibility circles at the moment. These primarily revolve around how browsers and assistive technology interpret and represent HTML semantics via accessibility APIs and to the end user, and how this is affected by the use of CSS style rules.  The wild west It feels as if understanding how browsers implement accessibility is like the wild west, in many respects it’s uncharted territory, unlike the specification of mainstream implementation of HTML, being specified and documented in explicit detail in HTML5. browsers implementers and AT implementers pretty much do their own thing, all acting in good faith, but without co-ordination or co-operation. This leads to inconsistencies across implementations and deviations from the subset of accessibility support implementation that is specified. Specification of accessibility support not needed A while back the editor of the HTML5 specification Ian Hickson made the following statement in reference to the HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide a document that is being developed in an attempt to nail down HTML accessibility implementation details: In fact, the proposed document is unnecessary. Vendors have not shown an  inability to read the existing normative specifications, and the text  does not help authors or readers of the specification. The problem being is that “existing normative specifications” do not provide details or guidance on many aspects of how accessibility support in browsers or AT is currently implemented or how it should be. There is the WAI-ARIA 1.0 User Agent Implementation Guide which is a good attempt at specifying how ARIA should be implemented, but this covers only ARIA, a subset of what needs to be specified. HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide This document that I am currently editing along with Cynthia Shelly from Microsoft, is attempting to provide details on how to implement the rest of what is now known as HTML5. It’s in it’s infancy, but recently the ongoing work has been given a major boost through the support for its development by Adobe Systems. Along with continuing support from The Paciello Group it means that I will have dedicated days each month for the next year to devote to the editing of the specification. CSS effects upon semantics As noted earlier, there has been discussions of late on how CSS rules affect HTML semantics. I think developers are fairly aware, for example that using display:none on content means that it will be hidden from all users (of CSS supporting browsers), including assistive technology that sits on top of the browsers, while content shifted offscreen will still be available to screen reader users. But there are other CSS related effects that are worrying and confusing developers, such as the use of display:block on table elements which removes all the table semantics in some browsers  and display:table on non table elements which turns the elements into a table. The effects of these seem counter intuitive since the mantra of CSS as the presentation layer and HTML as the semantic layer, is widely taught. If you are interested in discussing, researching and documenting the CSS accessibility issues, join the newly formed W3C CSS Accessibility Community Group. A non interoperable web is a non accessible web Currently we have accessibility layer implementation inconsistencies across browsers and assistive technologies, we have a lack of understanding of how features are implemented and a lack of documentation of accessibility features. This makes it harder for developers, implementers and most importantly end users. This situation will not change unless we work together to document and specify this stuff and seek implementation consistency across browsers and AT. A non-interoperable web is a non-accessible web.  Detecting if images are disabled in browsers  Posted on Friday, 21 October 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   I received an email from an old friend and colleague pointing out that with images disabled in the browser, the support information in the data tables on HTML5Accessibility.com disappears. An issue and an embarrassment! This has now been fixed.  Detecting if images are disabled in browsers I went searching on the internet to find a suitable script for detecting if images are displayed or not. I found this post Use Javascript to detect if images are disabled.The script appears to work fine in Internet Explorer and FireFox, but not in Chrome and Opera ans Safari. It also looked a bit complex for me. What I wanted was a simple method that worked cross browser. The problem To be clear, what I am referring to in this case is inline images, though the same method will work with CSS images as long as there is one img element on the page to test. On HTML5Accessibility.com the following pattern is being used, the CSS for which I borrowed from CSS in Action: Invisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users. HTML <img src=\"images/cross.png\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" alt=\"\"> <span class=\"hidden\">Not supported</span> CSS span.hidden { position:absolute; left:-10000px; top:auto; width:1px; height:1px; overflow:hidden; } This works great if you have images enabled (the presence of the images are not announced by screen readers due to the use of alt=”” and the text is announced, although it is not on screen), but not if you don’t, because the images are not displayed and the text is still hidden off screen, d’oh! Major modification 19/08/2012 Thanks to @thierrykoblentz for providing a much simpler method (offsetWidth) to check whether images are enabled/disabled! After testing more found offsetWidth alone was unreliable in IE, so have gone back to more complex check using readyState in conjunction with offsetWidth. Thanks anyway @thierrykoblentz! Tested in Firefox/Opera/Chrome/IE on windows all work fine! Try the updated test page in your fave browser/OS. The noImage() script function noimage() {  if ((document.getElementById(\\'flag\\').offsetWidth==1&&document.getElementById(\\'flag\\').readyState==\\'complete\\')||(document.getElementById(\\'flag\\').offsetWidth==1&&document.getElementById(\\'flag\\').readyState==undefined))  { var objHead = document.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\'); var objCSS = objHead[0].appendChild(document.createElement(\\'link\\')); objCSS.rel = \\'stylesheet\\'; objCSS.href = \\'alt.css\\'; objCSS.type = \\'text/css\\'; } } //add to body <body onload=\"noimage();checkHC();\"> <img id=\"flag\" src=\"clear.gif\" alt=\"\"> What  the script does It checks the value of the offsetWidth property of a 1 x 1 pixel image added to the top of the page. if the check returns true, images are enabled, if false images are disabled.   If images are enabled  it adds and external style sheet containing the style rules to hide the text off screen.  By default the text and images are visible, so that the text will be visible if users have JavaScript disabled.  Checking for Windows High Contrast It also seemed like a good idea to have the text visible when Windows high contrast mode is enabled (shift + alt + print screen keys), so I added the following function (borrowed from the AOL AXS script library), that checks if Windows high contrast mode is enabled. If it is enabled both images and text are displayed. function checkHC() { var e,c; //Create a test div e=document.createElement(\"div\"); //Set its color style to something unusual e.style.color=\"rgb(31,41,59)\"; //Attach to body so we can inspect it document.body.appendChild(e); //Use standard means if available, otherwise use the IE methods c=document.defaultView?document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(e,null).color:e.currentStyle.color; //Delete the test DIV document.body.removeChild(e); //get rid of extra spaces in result c=c.replace(/ /g,\"\"); //Check if we got back what we set //If not we are in high contrast mode if (c!=\"rgb(31,41,59)\"){ return true; } } I then wrapped then wrapped it all together and added it to HTML5Accessibility.com. There is also a test page available. The scripting is by no means elegant, if anybody wants to improve it please do!  Short note on the accessibility of styled form controls  Posted on Tuesday, 31 July 2018 by Scott O\\'Hara  Category: Development   Sticking with a native form control will almost always give your users a more accessible experience than trying to recreate one from scratch. Though the issue with native form controls is that they have an infamous reputation for being problematic to style. Outside of some of the HTML5 form controls, which have browser prefixed CSS selectors for styling hooks, this reputation still holds true. In some cases (e.g. option elements) styling support has actually decreased in some browsers. Fortunately, there have been many experiments with markup and CSS over the years to (mostly) get around the limitations of many native form controls, without having to disregard them completely. Styled and “Styled” form controls The tested form elements that have been styled either directly, or with some specific markup patterns, are all listed on the introductory page to The Accessibility of Styled Form Controls, which provides some additional context for each pattern. Most of these controls can be restyled without needing any JavaScript, save for but a few, such as file uploads, and ARIA reliant controls that would otherwise not function. But if you want to jump to a particular demo and test page, here are the links to each:  Styled Checkboxes Styled Radio Buttons Radio Button Star Rating Radio Button Pill Switch Checkbox ARIA Switch Button ARIA Toggle Button Switch Radio Button Group File Upload Range Slider Select Progress bar Meter Search Component  Be sure to check out the GitHub repository for these form controls. If you come across anything I missed with my testing, or have a pattern you think should be included, I’d appreciate it if you file an issue or create a pull request. Some are better than others While I wasn’t expecting all form elements to work perfectly with screen reader and browser combinations, there were some that stood out as having more problems than others. Particularly the progress and meter elements. While progress has better accessibility support than meter, the manner in which screen readers announced the elements did not always match up with the browser’s accessibility support. Furthermore, styling these elements actually lead to further issues in how they were exposed to screen readers (to the point that styling each could result in them being completely hidden to screen readers…) For more information on the accessibility support for HTML5 form controls, and the term accessibility support in general, you can review:  HTML5 Accessibility: Form Controls What does accessibility supported mean? – By Léonie Watson (2016)   Short note on alt in HTML  Posted on Monday, 14 April 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   It is no longer a WCAG 2.0 conformance failure to have an <img> without an alt attribute, as long as the img element has an accessible name provided using another method such as aria-label. It is still a conformance error in HTML  to have an <img> without an alt attribute (unless the img has a caption provided using the figure and figcaption elements)  Why are there now divergent requirements? The HTML conformance requirement takes into account the accessibility and usability needs of users: 4.7.5.1.1 Examples of scenarios where users benefit from text alternatives for images  They have a very slow connection and are browsing with images disabled. They have a vision impairment and use text to speech software. They have a cognitive impairment and use text to speech software. They are using a text-only browser. They are listening to the page being read out by a voice Web browser. They have images disabled to save on download costs. They have problems loading images or the source of an image is wrong.

Is the Alt Attribute Dead? – Article on Updated F65 – WAI email thread     Visualising browser accessibility bugs  Posted on Sunday, 8 July 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   On revisiting what I believe to be a simple to fix bug, filed in January on Webkit’s ARIA implementation, unsurprisingly I found it not yet fixed. Part of the reason this occurs is because there is limited resources available and accessibility bugs often are not a priority as their negative effects are not apparent and they generally don’t negatively impact many users. Example 1 ARIA spinbutton role incorrectly mapped in webkit Making it real: From reading the bug report it seems rather technical and obscure, but what effect does it have? For users of assistive technology who encounter a JavaScript spin button widget such as the DOJO spinner widget, they will ‘see’ this: A progress bar as displayed in Chrome is what an AT user \\'sees\\'. Instead of what everybody else sees: A spin button displayed in Chrome is what everybody else sees. Consider how long this bug would be open if the bug affected the visual display and interaction as shown above. I say interaction because, although a user can theoretically still interact with a spin button whose role is a progress bar, how does the user know? Both the role and the visual display of the control convey essential information on what the control is and how to interact with it. Progress bars are usually non interactive, they just convey information, the whole point of a spin button is for the user to change its value to input data. Now in the case of this bug, I emailed the guy who the bug had been assigned to and got a reply almost immediately saying he would look at it this week, so fingers crossed. Update: this bug is now being fixed! Example 2 when using aria-labelledby acc name is duplicated in acc description This is a bug I filed a few days ago, for a behaviour I initially discovered back in January. My bad for not filing a bug earlier, I thought I had… Making it real: Again the bug report is dry and technical, but how does this bug affect users of Assistive Technology (AT)? For an AT user who encounters a check box, for example, labelled using aria-labelledby: They will get this:  label text label text While everybody else gets:  label text Same question as before. How long before a bug like would be fixed if it affected not only AT users, if the label text was visibly duplicated on the page?  alt in HTML5 Required? – to be or not to be  Posted on Thursday, 7 February 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Standards Tag: HTML   There has been much discussion both within and outside of the W3C HTML5 Working Group about the HTML5 editor’s decision to make the alt attribute optional, to cover those cases where: In certain rare cases, the image is simply a critical part of the content, and there might even be no alternative text available. There has been (and is)Â opposition to this decision, some of those within the working group who question the decision, sought a formal response from the W3C Protocols and Formats Working Group (The PFWG looks at the formal Web technologies from an accessibility perspective). A formal response has now been submitted to the HTML5 working Group. A summary of the response:   By the principles, HTML5 wants to support accessibility By their charters, WAI groups (here WCAG) are the go-to experts in matters of accessibility WCAG requires @alt (WCAG1) or the function that in HTML4 is provided by @alt (WCAG2) [editorial note — add links] By the principles, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Conclusion: barring the introduction of new, good reasons for a change, the failure of the HTML5 draft to make @alt on <img> an across-the-board requirement (even if sometimes it has the value of “”) is a bug.   Â note: emphasis added. There has not as yet been anyÂ feedback from the editor or other proponents of the decision to the formal response, but as it was only sent yesterday (6th of February), it’s early days yet.

These include:  Talkback – a screen reader that uses spoken feedback to describe your actions and to tell you about alerts and notifications on screen Switch Access – enables you to control your device with one or more switches. Useful for people with limited mobility, switch access provides an alternative to using the touch screen Large text – allows you to choose your preferred font size by increasing and decreasing the text size on your device  In this post I’ll look at how to use and optimize Talkback for accessibility testing. All testing for the post was done using Nexus 9, version 5.1.1 and should be valid for KitKat (4.4.x) and Lollipop (5.x). Optimizing Talkback Before you start using Talkback there are a few useful settings that you’ll need to configure to make testing a little easier. These are accessed via Settings > Talkback > Settings.  Enable explore by touch – Select ‘Explore by touch’, this makes it possible to navigate by moving your finger across the screen and listening to items being announced. In Android 6 (HTC1) ‘explore by touch’ is turned on automatically when enabling TalkBack. Enable enhanced web scripts – Select ‘Enhance web accessibility’, this tells Talkback to provide visual guidance when navigating. Note that this option was deprecated since 4.2 as it was considered experimental. Display speech output – On the Developer Settings screen, accessed via a button at the foot of the Talkback Accessibility screen, select ‘Display speech output’. This enables Talkback to display red text at the foot of the screen that mirrors what it is saying. Take the ‘Explore by touch’ tutorial -accessed via the Talkback settings screen this is probably the most important thing to do before you get testing as you will learn basic gestures and navigation. Accessibility shortcut – Map the Talkback on/off button to the power button via the Settings > Accessibility  and enable ‘Accessibility shortcut’. To switch Talkback on/off press the power key until the device vibrates, makes a sound or you see the ‘Power off’ message, then press and hold two fingers on the screen. This should work however I have found it to be a little unreliable. It also takes slightly longer than you think to activate.  Navigation You can navigate with Talkback either by moving your finger around the screen and listening to what is under your finger being announced (explore by touch) or use gestures and swipe navigation. Gestures Core Talkback gestures can be found in the table below (source).    Action Gesture   Turn Talkback on and off Press the power key and hold two fingers on screen   Speak element Single tap   Activate an element Double tap   Scroll Two finger slide   Zoom One finger triple tap   Select next item Swipe right / down   Select previous Swipe left / up   Move to first item on screen Up then down   Move to last item on screen Down then up   Scroll forward (if you’re on a page longer than one screen) Right then left   Scroll back (if you’re on a page longer than one screen) Left then right   Move slider down (such as volume) Left then right   Home button Up then left   Back button Down then left   Recent apps Left then up   Notifications Right then down   Open local context menu Up then right   Open global context menu Down then right    The global and local context menus The global and context menus  provide shortcuts for navigating certain types of content The global context menu works across all applications. It can be opened by swiping down and right with one finger, then dragging your finger in a circle to hear the options The global context menu shown on screen as a circular dial The table below list options in the global context menu (source):    Global context menu feature Description   Quick navigation Hear all of the items on the screen as you move your finger in a circle. This option isn’t available if you’re using the list version of the context menu instead of the circle version (by enabling “Show Context Menu as list” in Talkback settings).   Read from top Hear a read-out of all items on the screen, starting from the top.   Read last item again Hear the last verbalization again.   Spell last item Hear a letter-by-letter spelling of Talkback’s last verbalization.   Read from next item Hear a read-out of all items on the screen, starting from the last focused item.   Talkback settings This option is outside the circle menu, at the top-right corner of your screen. Selecting this option opens the Talkback settings screen.   Text to speech settings This option is outside the circle menu, at the bottom-right corner of your screen. Selecting this option opens your text-to-speech settings.    Tip: A useful option when testing is being able to quickly pause Talkback. This can be done via the  global context menu. Once the menu is open select ‘Pause Talkback’ positioned in the top left of the screen. This will give you a warning that Talkback will be suspended. Once done you can resume TalkBack by dragging down on the notifications pane and selecting ‘TalkBack is suspended. Tap to resume”. You’ll find that TalkBack is automatically resumed when the lock screen is on; this is so TalkBack users can unlock the device. The local context menu will change depending on what the focus is on and is opened by swiping up and right with one finger, then dragging your finger in a circle to hear the options The local context menu appears visually on screen shown on screen as a circular dial The table below list options in the local context menu (source):    Local context menu feature Description   Default Each swipe to the right reads the content of the focused item.   Page Each swipe to the right speaks all of the items on the current page.   Paragraph Each swipe to the right speaks one paragraph of the currently focused item.   Line Each swipe to the right speaks a single line of the currently focused item.   Word Each swipe to the right speaks one word of the currently focused item.   Character Each swipe to the right speaks one character of the currently focused item.    When you activate the local context menu from screens other than your home screen, you may hear alternative features outlined in the table below (source):    Local context menu feature Description   Page navigation Open a new local context menu with options for moving to the next or previous page.   Curser control menu Open a new local context menu with options for moving the cursor and editing text.  Options in the cursor control menu include: Move cursor to beginning, Move cursor to end, Cut, Copy, Paste, Select all, Start selection mode and End selection mode. To move the cursor while in an edit box, you can tap the volume keys.     Links menu When you navigate to text that contains links, you can open the local context menu, and select the Links submenu to select one of the links included in the text.   Label controls edit customized labels for unlabeled content. Sometimes applications are missing labels on images. You can use Talkback to create your own labels for these images, to make it easier to identify them in the future.   Word Each swipe to the right speaks one word of the currently focused item.   Change granularity menu Select this option to open a new local context menu with the navigation granularity options listed above (Default, Page, Paragraph, Line, Word and Character).    Browser and Talkback support The native browser, Chrome, and Talkback has basic support for web browsing. Some of the techniques found in WAI ARIA or HTML5 may not be  announced correctly by Talkback. Firefox for Android has better support for WAI ARIA and HTML5 as well as more robust support for core HTML such as headings, WAI ARIA Landmarks, data tables and so on. As such basic navigation is not supported in Chrome we recommend testing on Firefox for Android. Regardless of how well Talkback supported web content it is important to code to web standards and follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Using both Chrome and Firefox you can navigate by swiping up, down, left and right to use spatial navigation through screen elements. Using the ‘Quick navigation’ option in the global content menu you can drag your finger in a circle to listen sequentially to all items on screen in the natural focus order. This is a good way to test focus order should swiping be sticky or not work (which I have found happens from time to time). Firefox Firefox uses the three-finger swipe to navigate elements. A three-finger swipe up or down cycles between list items (not lists), headings, landmarks, links and form elements such as text inputs and checkboxes. A three-finger swipe left or right moves up or down the page by the selected element: Firefox also has support for quick navigation keys with Talkback that work with physical keyboards, connected Bluetooth keyboards, or on screen keyboards. Keystrokes will only work in HTML and not on the browser chrome or in text fields.

My first impression is it seems very slick, fast, has cool features such as speed dial and its intuitive to use for mouse users. I noticed yesterday that people on the Window Eyes user mailing list were discussing it and whether they could use it. And David Bolter asked the question “Is Chrome accessible?” So I decided to do some testing of Google Chrome. Here is a quick rundown of the accessibility support I found in Google Chrome. Keyboard Operability Google Chrome has many keyboard shortcuts to allow use of the application with the keyboard alone. There appears to be no direct method to open and navigate the ‘control current page’ and ‘customize and control Google Chrome’ menus. So features such as ‘help’ and ‘options’ cannot be accessed with the keyboard. OS Accessibility Options Support Operating Systems such as Windows have built in accessibility features like ‘high contrast mode’ and the ability to increase default font size. Google Chrome does not currently support high contrast mode, but it does inherit font size settings. The image below shows a screenshot of Google Chrome (top) and Firefox (bottom) with Windows high contrast mode enabled.  The image below is a screenshot of the Google Chrome ‘Options Dialog’. While high contrast foreground and background colours are inherited, the majority of the text becomes unreadable.  Exposure of Name,Role and State information Google Chrome Interface In order for software user interfaces to be accessible to assistive technology users programatically defined information about the interface elements neeeds to be provided. Many of the Google Chrome interface elements do not provide parts of this information. Example of accessibility information provided by a typical control in Google Chrome.     Property Value   Name none   Role Client (incorrect – should be push button)   State focused,focusable   Description none    Example of accessibility information provided by a typical control in Firefox.     Property Value   Name Next   Role push button   State focused,focusable   Description 4 of 8    Google Chrome Document Pane Access to information about content in the HTML document being displayed in the browser is also required by assistive technology, so it can be conveyed to users. Although information is exposed for controls, from a quick test with the NVDA screen reader, no information is announced about plain text or focusable elements such as links in a web page displayed in Google Chrome. Although some rudimentary information is exposed about controls, but not links, this information is not being picked up by NVDA. Example of accessibility information provided by a HTML link in Google Chrome. example link    Property Value   Name none   Role grouping (incorrect)   State focused,focusable   Value none    Example of accessibility information provided by a HTML link in Firefox. example link    Property Value   Name Example link   Role link   State focused,focusable,linked   Value http://www.paciellogroup.com/    WAI ARIA Support? It does not appear that any information conveyed through the use of WAI-ARIA attributes is exposed, but that is not surprising as indicated above, even basic informtion about native HTML controls is not exposed. Conclusion This release of Google Chrome does not appear to have been developed with the needs of users with disabilites taken into account, apart from limited keyboard shortcuts, basic support required for accessibility is absent.  doesn’t work in lynx  Posted on Monday, 24 February 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   I regularly encounter the argument that a particular feature is not accessible because it doesn’t work in a text browser such as Lynx. Most recently this claim was in reference to the HTML canvas element. Funnily enough if the canvas element is provided with a HTML based sub DOM it works fine. Which is part of the reason why myself and others have been working for years to get robust accessibility support implemented for the canvas element. Sorry, to be clear, supporting Lynx is not the reason: Allowing, supporting and encouraging authors to provide a HTML based sub-DOM for content that is inaccessible when solely painted on a canvas and interaction that is inaccessible when solely implemented on the painted canvas using JavaScript, is the reason.  But I digress. I think using the text browser argument is bogus. Text browsers have limited functionality and support a small subset of the semantics and features of HTML. While we as developers and advocates should be mindful of such software, we cannot be held to not using features of HTML because they don’t work in Lynx. What do you think?  aViewer – accessibility inspection tool on Github  Posted on Wednesday, 22 April 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: News Tag: aViewer   The Paciello Group are pleased to announce that, with the support of Google, the aViewer accessibility object inspection tool source code is now available on Github under an open source licence.  The Accessibility Viewer (aViewer) is an inspection tool for Windows that displays the accessibility API information (MSAA, IAccessible2, UI Automation, ARIA, HTML DOM) exposed by web browsers to the operating system, and thus to any assistive technology (AT) such as screenreaders. We thank Dominic Mazzoni and Google for their interest and support to help make aViewer an open source project. We look forward to contributions to further develop aViewer. And we thank Jun for his continued commitment and dedication over the past 10 years to the development of the accessibility testing tools that The Paciello Group makes available to the web development and accessibility community.  Web Accessibility Toolbar 2012  Posted on Friday, 13 April 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: WAT   The Web Accessibility Toolbar has been updated with 2 new features: Thanks to Jun for all his work!  Check current page using the W3C Nu Markup Validation Service (can check local/behind firewall pages as long as there is an Internet connection)  check using page DOCTYPE check using page DOCTYPE (in a new tab/window) check using HTML5 DOCTYPE – overrides page doctype check using HTML5 DOCTYPE – overrides page doctype(in a new tab/window) Filter Validation results (shows only results relevant to WCAG 2.0 success criterion 4.1.1 Parsing) selecting this on the results page of the W3C Nu Markup Validation Service will filter out any errors not relevant to the WCAG 2.0 parsing criteria. (Refer to: WCAG 2.0 parsing error bookmarklet for more details.)   Open in other browsers: This feature replaces the Firefox and Opera buttons on the previous WAT version. It allows you to add any browser you have installed. Once added the browsers will show in the list and you can open the current page open in IE, in the selected browser.

Notes on accessible CSS image sprites  Posted on Monday, 20 August 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The issue of CSS image sprites has been raised again on the Web Accessibility Initiative Interest Group mailing list. Here is the advice we provide on the issue:  CSS image sprite issues  A default HTML method to add a text alternative is not provided. When images are disabled the sprite is not displayed.  Note: This is not an accessibility issue, but is a usability issue . If you do not want to test whether images are disabled, there is a  high contrast mode (only) detection script available. When high contrast mode is enabled in the Windows OS, the sprite is not displayed (CSS background images are not displayed in high contrast mode).  CSS image sprite issue fixes  Include alternative text inside the element that the CSS background image is attached to. If images are enabled and Windows high contrast mode is not enabled use JavaScript to add a style sheet that visually hides the text alternative, but is still  available to assistive technology. Use JavaScript to detect when images are disabled and remove the CSS visually hidden display state of the text alternative. Use JavaScript to detect when Windows high contrast mode is enabled and remove the CSS visually hidden display state of the text alternative.  Accessible CSS image sprite example page – example files (zip) Example code (JavaScript): function HCTest() { var objDiv, strColor, objFlag; //reference to img element used to check if images are disabled objFlag = document.getElementById(\\'flag\\'); //Create a test div objDiv = document.createElement(\\'div\\'); //Set its color style to something unusual objDiv.style.color = \\'rgb(31,41,59)\\'; //Attach to body so we can inspect it document.body.appendChild(objDiv); //Use standard means if available, otherwise use the IE methods strColor = document.defaultView?document.defaultView.getComputedStyle(objDiv, null).color : objDiv.currentStyle.color; //Delete the test DIV document.body.removeChild(objDiv); //Check if we got back what we set (strColor== ??) If not we are in high contrast mode // Use .offsetwidth and .readyState (for IE) to check if images are enabled //If either images are disabled or high contrast is enabled (or both) the CSS stylesheet link will not be added to the page and the visually hidden text will be displayed in place of the missing background image if (((objFlag.offsetWidth === 1 && objFlag.readyState === \\'complete\\')||(objFlag.offsetWidth === 1 && objFlag.readyState === undefined)) && (strColor === \\'rgb(31,41,59)\\' || strColor === \\'rgb(31, 41, 59)\\'))  { var objHead = document.getElementsByTagName(\\'head\\'); var objCSS = objHead[0].appendChild(document.createElement(\\'link\\')); objCSS.rel = \\'stylesheet\\'; objCSS.href = \\'alt.css\\'; objCSS.type = \\'text/css\\'; } }  Example code (HTML): //call function onload <body onload=\"HCTest();\"> //image for testing offsetwidth <img id=\"flag\" src=\"clear.gif\" alt=\"\"> //example link with CSS background image <a href=\"#\" class=\"sprite\"> //text label displayed when CSS image is not displayed  <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Select</span></a> ... </body> Example code (CSS): In a separate file .visually-hidden { position: absolute !important; clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* IE6, IE7 */ clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px); padding:0 !important; border:0 !important; height: 1px !important; width: 1px !important; overflow: hidden; } Notes by Ted Drake, on use of the off screen technique described: Using negative position can create long scroll bars when localizing a site for a rtl language. Also, it uses CSS properties that are commonly used and easy to accidentally over-ride. The Yahoo Accessibility Lab recommends using clip for content that should be hidden from the visual user, yet available to screen reader users. Thierry Koblentz has a great article on this technique, as well as the underlying philosophy behind using the correct CSS techniques for hiding content. Clip your hidden content for better accessibility What the technique does The technique above resolves the issues of provision of a text alternative in all circumstances and provision of a visible label when images are disabled or high contrast mode is enabled.

THUS SPOKE HTML  Posted on Monday, 26 October 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: StandardsCategory: UX   For many of us HTML as a language is expressed visually and often implicitly as graphical user interfaces (often dressed in fancy CSS threads). For others it is an aural and explicitly expressed language, one in which shape, color and decoration play little part, its meaning is conveyed by words and interaction behaviours.  Typical support patterns of HTML elements by screen readers:  Identification of an element by role as the user moves through the content. Announcement of the text content of an element. Announcement of the start and end of an element. Change in voice as the content of an element is announced. Announcement of an elements accessible name and/or description Announcement of states and properties. Emission of a beep or other sound when an element with a particulat state or property receives virtual focus. Instructions on how to operate interactive elements such as form controls. Navigation of elements by keyboard and “quick access” lists of a particular elements, list items are linked to each instance of an element on the page.  Note: The combination of patterns supported varies from element to element and support for a particular element varies between screen reader software. Example of aural UI of HTML heading elements The h1-h6 (heading) elements are imbued with visual semantics due to their style, and placement in the context of other content, but styling is a weak semantic, as is placement alone, and there are no rules or best practices about maintaining any visual style to indicate a headings style is an expression of its role in document structure. In fact the whole point of CSS is to allow developers to modify the default styles of HTML elements. But the aural semantics of a heading are explicit and robust, regardless of its style in the document a <h1> is a <h1>, is a <h1>… unless overidden with ARIA. This why there are a set of document conformence rules for use of ARIA in HTML, to guide and constrain developers use of ARIA, so as not to screw up the native semantics of HTML.  Aural UI of h1-h6 elements on a test page: “text content of heading, Heading level 1″ “text content of heading, Heading level 2″ “text content of heading, Heading level 3″ “text content of heading, Heading level 4″ “text content of heading, Heading level 5″ “text content of heading, Heading level 6″ Example of navigation features for h1-h6 elements provided by a particular screen reader:  List Headings INSERT+F6  Next Heading H Prior Heading SHIFT+H First Heading ALT+INSERT+HOME Last Heading ALT+INSERT+END  Next Heading at Level – number keys 1 through 6 Prior Heading at Level SHIFT+1 through 6  First Heading at Level ALT+CTRL+INSERT+1 through 6 Last Heading at Level ALT+CTRL+INSERT+ SHIFT+1 through 6  If you would like to hear more; the Aural UI of the Elements of HTML is a work in progress that aims to document how aural user agents bring HTML to life for their users.

Using the HTML lang attribute  Posted on Tuesday, 14 June 2016 by Léonie Watson  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards Tag: HTML   What do an American actor, a British sitcom character and an HTML attribute have in common? If you’ve ever watched Mary Poppins and winced at Dick Van Dyke’s attempt at an English accent, or found yourself laughing at Delboy Trotter trying to speak French in Only Fools and Horses, you may well guess the answer.  The HTML lang attribute is used to identify the language of text content on the web. This information helps search engines return language specific results, and it is also used by screen readers that switch language profiles to provide the correct accent and pronunciation. To set the primary language for a document, you use the lang attribute on the <html> element: <html lang=\"en\"> ... </html> The lang attribute takes an ISO language code as its value. Typically this is a two letter code such as “en” for English, but it can also be an extended code such as “en-gb” for British English. The lang attribute must also be used to identify chunks of text in a language that is different from the document’s primary language. For example:  <html lang=\"en\"> ... <body> <p>This page is written in English.</p> <p lang=\"fr\">Sauf pour ce qui est écrit en mauvais français.</p> </body> </html>  The lang attribute is forgotten surprisingly often, perhaps because it makes no apparent difference unless you use a screen reader or you are a search engine. If you’re in any doubt at all what a difference it makes though, listen to this screen reader demo!  HTML5 Accessibility Chops: using nested figure elements  Posted on Friday, 25 November 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   If you have a number of related images (or other content) with caption text,  you can use nested figure elements to associate both a group caption and an individual caption to each  instance using the figcaption element. Using nested figure elements is a useful method for grouping related content instances, such as images. Examples are provided on a separate page: Use of nested figures Recommended methods – grouped images Examples of recommended methods for marking up groups of  images which have associated captions:  Example 1- caption text visible by default  Example 2 – hide/show caption text using CSS   How NOT TO markup groups of  images with associated captions DO NOT use the title attribute anti-pattern to caption the individual images within a figure. An example of how not to mark up groups of images which have associated captions is provided in Example 3 – bad code example   latest aViewer alpha 2012  Posted on Friday, 27 July 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Refer to: aViewer 2013  Basic screen reader commands for accessibility testing  Posted on Monday, 5 January 2015 by Léonie Watson  Category: Strategy   Updated 1st Feb 2016. When you test your website with a screen reader there are a few basic commands you should know. Just remember not to make design decisions based only on your tests. Even with these useful screen reader commands, you won’t experience things in the same way as a person who uses a screen reader all the time.  There isn’t much information available about the platforms, devices and screen readers that people use. The best source of information we have is the WebAIM screen reader survey (last conducted in January 2014). It’s based on a very small sample of people, but it still provides a useful glimpse into the technologies used by blind or partially sighted people. This post focuses on four popular desktop screen readers: Jaws, Narrator, NVDA and VoiceOver. Jaws Jaws is a proprietary screen reader for Windows from Freedom Scientific. It can be installed on the desktop or run from a portable USB drive. A paid license is required. Jaws browser support Jaws officially supports Firefox and Internet Explorer. Jaws commands Jaws uses the Numpad Insert key to modify the behaviour of other keys on a desktop keyboard, or the Capslock key on a laptop keyboard. This is known as the Jaws key.  Jaws key commands  Action Command   Read from cursor point to the bottom of the page Jaws key + Numpad 2   Move to next focusable element Tab   Move to next landmark r   Move to main landmark q   Move to next heading h   Move to next list l   Move to next graphic g   Move to next form field f   Move to next table t   Navigate table content Control + Alt + up/down/left/right arrow keys   Show list of all landmarks Jaws key + Control + r   Show list of all headings Jaws key + f6   Show list of all links Jaws key + f7   Stop Jaws talking Control   Toggle virtual cursor on/off Jaws key + z   Refresh virtual buffer Jaws key + Escape   Note: Use the Shift key with the above commands to move to the previous instance of the element instead of the next. For example Shift + h moves to the previous heading. Jaws further help The Jaws user guide contains further information. Narrator Narrator is the integrated screen reader available in Windows. In Windows 10, turn Narrator on/off with Windows + Enter. Narrator browser support Narrator officially supports Internet Explorer and Edge. Narrator commands Narrator uses the Capslock key to modify the behaviour of other keys on a desktop or laptop keyboard. This is known as the Narrator key.  Narrator key commands  Action Command   Read from cursor point to the bottom of the page Capslock + m   Move to next item Capslock + right arrow   Move to previous item Capslock + left arrow   Move to main landmark Capslock + n   Move to next heading Capslock + j   Move to next table Capslock + k   Navigate table content Capslock + f3/f4   Stop Narrator talking Control  Note: Use the Shift key with the above commands to move to the previous instance of the element instead of the next. For example Shift + Capslock + j moves to the previous heading. Narrator further help The Windows keyboard shortcuts guide includes all available Narrator commands. NVDA NVDA (Non Visual Desktop Access) is a free (open source) screen reader for Windows from NVAccess. It can be installed to the desktop or run from a portable USB drive. NVDA browser support NVDA officially supports Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer. NVDA commands NVDA uses the Numpad Insert key to modify the behaviour of other keys on a desktop keyboard, or the Capslock key on a laptop keyboard. This is known as the NVDA key.  NVDA key commands  Action Command   Read from cursor point to the bottom of the page NVDA key + Numpad 2   Move to next focusable element Tab   Move to next landmark d   Move to next heading h   Move to next list l   Move to next graphic g   Move to next form field f   Move to next table t   Navigate table content Control + Alt + up/down/left/right arrow keys   Show list of all headings, landmarks or links NVDA key + f7   Stop NVDA talking Control   Toggle browse mode on/off NVDA key + Space   Refresh virtual buffer NVDA key + f5   Note: Use the Shift key with the above commands to move to the previous instance of the element instead of the next. For example Shift + Tab moves to the previous focusable element. NVDA further information The NVDA user guide has further information. VoiceOver VoiceOver is the integrated screen reader available in Mac OSX (and all Apple iDevices). In Mac OSX turn VoiceOver on/off with Command f5. VoiceOver browser support VoiceOver officially supports Safari. VoiceOver commands VoiceOver uses the Control + Option keys to modify the behaviour of other keys. This is known as the VoiceOver (VO) key.  VoiceOver key commands  Action Command   Read from cursor point to the bottom of the page VO + a   Move to next focusable element Tab   Move to next landmark N/A   Move to next heading VO + Command + h   Move to next list VO + Command + x   Move to next graphic VO + Command + g   Move to next form field VO + Command + j   Move to next table VO + Command + t   Navigate table content VO + up/down/left/right arrow keys   Show all headings, links, landmarks (and other elements) on the rotor VO + u (then left/right/up/down cursor keys)   Stop VoiceOver talking Control   Note: Use the Shift key with the above commands to move to the previous instance of the element instead of the next. For example VO + Command + Shift + x moves to the previous list. VoiceOver further information The VoiceOver users guide has further information. There are a lot more key commands available for each screen reader. The commands in this post are not intended to be a comprehensive tutorial, but they will help you navigate a website to get a sense of how things work. If possible organise some usability testing with screen reader users (and people with other types of disability) to get a real understanding of how people experience your website.  Web Accessibility Toolbar 2011  Posted on Wednesday, 30 March 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   We have been working on bug fixes to the Web Accessibility Toolbar 2011, the update is now available for download, includes the latest version of aViewer. In honour of Jim Thatcher’s important and continuing contribution to making the web a more accessible medium, I have worked on an update to the Web Accessibility Toolbar for Internet Explorer, which includes new features that he has developed. Today At CSUN 2011, Jim Thatcher is being presented with a life time achievement award. Here at TPG we join the many others in the Accessibility Community that wish to thank Jim for his continuing leadership, insight and guidance on web accessibility. Jim has been a supporter of the Web Accessibility Toolbar since its initial release back in 2004. Of late, I have not had the time to work on developing the WAT. Jim emailed me last year with some scripts he had developed that provide additional features for checking web content. I had not incorporated these new features into the WAT, but thought the honouring of Jim at this years CSUN as the perfect excuse to pull my finger out and release an update. Its a leaner version than WAT 2.0, I have removed outdated, obsolete or buggy features, and added some new stuff. WAT 2011 Changes:  additional features for inspecting images, skip links and tables developed by Jim Thatcher bundled the aViewer application with the WAT added back-in a references menu Toolbar button to access the developer tools panel built in to Internet Explorer HTML5 conformance checking ARIA Landmark role display HTML5 section elements display removed a bunch of features that need updating or are obsolete.

Notes on HTML5 accessibility support in IE 10  Posted on Tuesday, 28 August 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   I am in the process of updating  HTML5Accessibility.com (ETA mid September) to take into account the changes in accessibility implementation support in the latest browser versions. I have decided not to update support information for Safari/Webkit on Windows and Opera on Windows or Mac as these browser/OS combinations  show no sign of active HTML accessibility implementation support. If and when they do, I will do detailed tests of theses browsers once again. Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 8 meanwhile, includes implementation of a number of new HTML5 features and improved accessibility support for other features.  new HTML5 feature accessibility support in IE 10 The progress element Default display of the progress element in IE 10 on Windows 8 code example <progress  value=\"30\" max=\"100\">30%</progress> As implemented the progress element exposes the appropriate accessibility information via the MSAA and UI automation accessibility APIs. input type=range Default display of input type=range (slider) element in IE 10 code example <input type=\"range\" max=\"11\" min=\"0\" value=\"7\"> As implemented the input type=range element exposes the appropriate accessibility information via the MSAA and UI automation accessibility APIs. It supports operation with the keyboard using the up/down/left/right arrow keys (incremental) or via the home and end keys (minimum/maximum). current value is displayed as a tooltip when the user drags the slider thumb with the mouse As illustrated above, a tooltip is displayed displaying the current slider value, but only when using a mouse, not when using the keyboard. The datalist element Default display of the datalist element in IE 10 code example <input type=\"text\" list=\"mylist\"> ><datalist id=”mylist”> <option value=\"Miss\" label=\"Miss\"></option> <option value=\"Mr\" label=\"Mr\"></option> <option value=\"Ms\" label=\"Ms\"></option> <option value=\"Mad Professor\" label=\"Prof\"> </option> </datalist> As implemented the datalist element when associated with a text input , turns it into a ComboBox. It exposes some of the appropriate accessibility information via the MSAA and UI  automation accessibility APIs. The presence of the list is not indicated via the role, state or properties of the input element, but the list and list items are exposed correctly. It supports operation with the keyboard: the list is displayed when the text input receives focus, the up/down arrow keys can be used to navigate the list items and the enter key selects a list item. A quick test with Narrator (built in Windows 8 screen reader) did not reveal any information being announced about the list or the list item and no indication about the presence of the list. the required attribute A message is displayed when a user submits a form without filling in required fields. code example <input type=\"text\" required> The required attribute is supported for visual users only. When an input that is required is not filled in by a user and the form is submitted, a red border appears around the input and a message is displayed (side note: the message is built using SVG). Note further, this occurs for each input that is in error, not only for the first input in the form, which is the current (not very useful) behaviour for other browsers that support required by displaying a message (e.g. Opera and FireFox). There appears to be no accessibility information reported via either MSAA or UI automation. A quick test with Narrator did not reveal any information being announced about required fields or their state. the audio element audio element user interface code example <audio controls></audio> The audio element has full keyboard and accessibility information support including accessible name, description, and accessKey information. Each control can be navigated to and operated using the keyboard.  Accessibility tree representation of the audio element in IE 10 the video element video element user interface with volume slider displayed. code example <video controls></video> The video element has full keyboard and accessibility information support including  accessible name, description, and accessKey information. Each control  can be navigated to and operated using the keyboard. Note the volume slider is represented in the accessibility tree, but is activated by focusing on the mute button then using the up/down arrow keys to modify the volume level. Accessibility tree representation of the video element in IE 10 The placeholder attribute The placeholder attribute value is used as the accessible name for the control if no other accessible name is provided. So from the placeholder attribute test page, only in the first test is the placeholder text used, otherwise it is not exposed in the MSAA or UIA accessibility APIs. code example <input type=text placeholder=\"poot\"> Conclusion Microsoft are doing things well in many respects, but there are gaps.  I particularly like the audio and video implementations which make it much easier for keyboard users to operate the controls without having to remember keyboard shortcuts. It is unfortunate though that each browser that supports accessibility and supports the placeholder attribute has implemented its use in accessible name calculation differently, its a an interoperability nightmare for developers and users.  alt and title content display in popular browsers  Posted on Tuesday, 5 January 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Recently Roger Johansson wrote a post about Safari, WebKit and alt text for missing images. In which he talks about how Webkit based browsers do not always display alt attribute content in place of an image when the image is not available or images are disabled. I have gone a little further into this issue by testing what is displayed with differing combinations of the alt and title attributes on images in IE, Firefox, Opera, Chrome and Safari.  Results summary  All browsers tested display the content of the alt attribute as text, if the image is missing or images are disabled, with the following exceptions:.  Opera truncates the display of text if it is longer than the img width. Chrome and Safari do not display the text if it is longer than the img width.   All browsers except Firefox render an area equal to the img dimensions. IE, Chrome and Safari always display an icon and border. Chrome and Safari (only) display the content of the title attribute as text if the alt attribute is not present. Chrome and Safari (only) the display of title attribute content is suppressed if an empty alt attribute (alt=\"\") is present. Opera displays the text “image” if images are not available and the img does not have an alt attribute.  Results Screenshots A page with screenshots of the test images in each of the browsers tested is available. Results Details A table containing detailed results can be found on the test page. Discussion The results reveal a lack of standardized display behaviour across browsers, which makes it difficult for authors to provide a predictable experience to users in cases where images are not available or users have disabled the display of images to suit their requirements.  It would be useful if the recommended behaviour was clearly specified in the HTML5 specification, the current wording is not precise, which will result in a continuation of the current diversity of implemented aproaches.  HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives  Posted on Monday, 17 May 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives is a work in progress currently edited by me, I encourage anyone with an interest to contribute to its development.  The HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives document is intended as a replacement for the text alternative examples and authoring conformance requirements in section 4.8.1.1 Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images, of the current editors draft of the W3C HTML5 specification. Aims of HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives:  Provide clear and practical advice on how to provide appropriate text alternatives for images using currently supported techniques. How to make use of the new features available in HTML5 and WAI-ARIA for providing text alternatives. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of each technique in reference to browser and assistive technology support. Provide normative rules for each technique in regards to whether its correct use results in a conforming HTML5 document. Harmonization of HTML5 document conformance with WCAG 2.0 in regards to image text alternatives.  How to get involved If you want to comment or contribute on the HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives draft you can file a bug or email: faulkner.steve@gmail.com or email a comment to public-html-comments@w3.org. To get involved further you can join the W3C HTML Working Group.  Google Chrome 2.0 Accessibility Improvements?  Posted on Monday, 1 June 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: Chrome   When Google first released Chrome back in September 2008, I carried out a quick and dirty accessibility analysis of it. With the release of Google chrome 2.0 I though it worthwhile to have another look to see what improvements have been made. While there has been progress, for many users with disabilities, Google Chrome is still unusable.  Keyboard Operability Improvements The Chrome Assistive Technology Support document states “All functionality in the toolbar should be accessible from the keyboard alone (please report any bugs, if found).” The toolbar controls and menus are now navigable using the keyboard shortcut SHIFT+ALT+T to set focus on the toolbar. Use right and left arrows on the keyboard to navigate to different buttons on the toolbar.  Google Chrome Keyboard Shortcuts  Google Chrome UI Keyboard Accessibility  There are still a number of outstanding keyboard accessibility issues, which are being worked on and others that currently have no resources assigned to their resolution. OS Accessibility Options Support Google Chrome still does not support Windows High Contrast mode color settings for the main browser interface and web pages, I thought initially that high contrast color support for dialogs had improved, but realized that this was due to some text labels now being totally obscured rather than the text being fuzzy. Unfortunately the High Contrast mode support is not being actively worked on.  Exposure of Name,Role and State information Google Chrome Interface The mapping of the various controls and widgets, that make up chrome’s chrome, to the MSAA accessibility API has improved. Technical details are available in the Chrome Assistive Technology Support Implementation Roadmap – Windows. Google Chrome Web Content Due to the multi-process architecture of Chrome, the MSAA implementation here is a bit more complex than normally required. The MSAA implementation is still being worked on by Jonas Klink. It is by no means complete, but it’s current state can be checked in the latest build of Chromium by using a flag (chrome.exe –enable-renderer-accessibility) to turn on MSAA support. The technical details of current support and issues is available in the Implementation Roadmap – Windows WAI-ARIA Support Supporting whatever ARIA is currently implemented in WebKit, and exposed through their MSAA. Recent testing of WebKit support for WAI-ARIA indicates that implementation is currently limited to ARIA roles that map to native HTML controls (See results for Safari). Conclusion The current verion of Google Chrome does not have the basic support required for accessibility. Support is in development, but Google needs to dedicate more resources if they are going to provide a browser, any time soon, that rivals Firefox or Internet Explorer in terms of accessibility for users with disabilities.  Notes on accessibility of text replacement using HTML5 canvas  Posted on Tuesday, 9 June 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   Roger Johannson recently blogged on issues with Cufon Accessibility in relation to Assistive Technology, which is well worth a read. It prompted me to do a little testing: One of the examples of the utility of canvas that has emerged is its use in rendering text using custom fonts. Cufon, for example, is a text replacement tool using canvas for browsers that support it and VML (for Internet Explorer). So it is quite obvious that the advice in the HTML 5 specification to refrain from using canvas “when a more suitable element is available” is likely to be widely ignored, as can be seen from examples of use linked from the Cufón Demos page. Providing an Accessible Alternative From a reading of the HTML 5 specification, providing an accessible alternative, to text rendered as a bitmap using canvas, can in theory be handled easily: When authors use the canvas element, they must also provide content that, when presented to the user, conveys essentially the same function or purpose as the bitmap canvas. This content may be placed as content of the canvas element. The contents of the canvas element, if any, are the element’s fallback content. So providing a text fallback for a canvas based text replacement like Cufón can be achieved by placing text inside the canvas element: <canvas> text </canvas> Other HTML elements can be included inside the canvas element: <canvas><p> text </p></canvas> User Agent Behaviour The results of this should be:  For browsers which support canvas and have JavaScript enabled, the content inside the canvas element is not displayed. For browsers that do not support canvas or have JavaScript disabled, the content inside the canvas element is displayed. Assistive technologies such as screen readers can announce the content inside the canvas element, accessing it via the HTML DOM.  These are the results for browsers in most cases, but Firefox does not display the fallback content when JavaScript is disabled. Unfortunately at this point in time, no assistive technology (that I know of) announces the content contained within the canvas element in browser with canvas support. I contacted the developers of JAWS (no reply), Window Eyes (no firm date for support) and NVDA (initial investigation indicates there is an issue in Firefox). So the reality for AT users is, if they use a browser that supports canvas, an accessible alternative is not currently available to them if the content is contained within the canvas element. Providing an accessible alternative when the canvas element is self closing In the case of Cufón, the canvas element is added to the page using document.createElement(\"canvas\"). This method does not result in an element with start and end tags, but rather: <canvas /> Adding a canvas element to a page using scripting appears to be quite a common method, so in many cases fallback will not be contained within the canvas element. Cufón does add ‘fallback’ text which is hidden from visual display using the CSS ‘display:none‘, unfortunately this also hides the text from AT that supports CSS (JAWS for example). <canvas /> <span style=\"display:none\"> text </span> The use of ‘display:none’ in Cufón appears to be due to the reason for the provision of the fallback being for printing purposes (text is set to be displayed in the print stylesheet), not for providing an accessible text alternative for the images of text. For the Cufón fallback text, or any accessible content alternatives for <canvas /> to be hidden from display, but available to AT, the content should be hidden offscreen using CSS: Example class for hiding content offscreen: span.fallback{ position: absolute; left: -999em; width: 0.1em; overflow: hidden; } <canvas /> <span class=\"fallback\"> text </span> Any span element that is assigned the ‘.fallback’ class is positioned absolutely outside of the main viewport. The content of the span is very slim with its overflow property set to hidden to help ensure that the content doesn’t bleed into the main viewport.

Some screen readers allow users to gather a list of links from a page, but these types of link phrases are usually meaningless when read out of context. This article demonstrates a technique that allows ambiguous link phrases to be rendered visually in a page, whilst making sense to screen readers, and other non-graphical devices, that might render the links out of context. Ambiguous Link Phrases Checkpoint 13.1 of WCAG 1.0, a priority 2 checkpoint, requires that authors clearly identify the target of each link. Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense when read out of context either on its own or as part of a sequence of links. Link text should also be terse. For example, in HTML, write “Information about version 4.3” instead of “click here”. In addition to clear link text, content developers may further clarify the target of a link with an informative link title (e.g., in HTML, the title attribute). The purpose of this checkpoint is to ensure that the visitor clearly understands the purpose and destination of each link in a document. This is particularly useful to screen reader users that may read link phrases out of context. Visually, ambiguous link phrases, such as, “click here”, “Read more”, and so on, might make sense when rendered visually in a graphical browser. However, the same ambiguous link phrases don’t make any sense whatsoever when read out of context. For example, JAWS has an option to display a list of links on the page with Insert + F7. Along with the JAWS keystroke to list all headings on a page (Insert + F6), gathering a list of links is a popular way for JAWS users to orientate themselves and quickly discover what they’re looking for in a document. Although checkpoint 13.1 specifically mentions using the title attribute, the title attribute has very poor accessibility support with current user agents. By default, it isn’t announced automatically by most screen readers, and has poor keyboard support from major browsers. It is possible to access the content of the title in some major browsers, but the discoverability isn’t obvious. Fortunately, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) offer a far better method to help developers provide context for non-visual user agents. Some people argue that the content of a document isn’t intended to be read out of context, and they do have a point. However, ambiguous link phrases can be difficult to understand by all users, including screen reader users, even when they are read in context. As ambiguous link phrases can be difficult to comprehend by everyone, and given the fact that some screen readers offer their users the ability to extract links from a document to determine what links they have available, best practice is to ensure that all link phrases make sense when read out of context. The following image illustrates what a JAWS user might be faced with from ambiguous link phrases in a typical blog:  The link phrases in this example are meaningless, and there is no way that a typical screen reader user could reliably make sense of these link phrases, even though they might make perfect sense when rendered visually. The link phrases in this example might seem contrived, but they are taken from a popular website that advocates web standards, and quite typical of most blogs. Uniform Design Patterns Sometimes, a design may require a uniform pattern, such as repetitive “Read More” link phrases, being visually rendered in the document. This is perfectly acceptable, but doesn’t mean that link phrases shouldn’t make sense when read out of context. For many years, developers have been using techniques to position content outside the visual viewport. The technique involves absolutely positioning the content outside of the viewport using CSS, so that those using graphical user agents that support CSS see the visual design as it was intended, and those using non-visual user agents receive the content including the parts that should be hidden visually. The following example demonstrates  a variation on the technique with a class that is applied to a span element that is included in the content to provide context for non-visual user agents. The content of the span is rendered invisible in graphical browsers that support CSS, but is available for all other user agents. A CSS class to provide context span.context  {  position: absolute !important;  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* IE6, IE7 */  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);  padding:0 !important;  border:0 !important;  height: 1px !important;  width: 1px !important;  overflow: hidden;  } Markup demonstrating the use of the context class The following markup demonstrates how the context class might be used to provide context with a span element within a link phrase, without effecting how it is rendered visually in a graphical browser. <a href=\"dest.html\" href=\"dest.html\">Read more    <span class=\"context\"> about the origins of lemons</span></a>   This example would result in graphical browsers with CSS support displaying a link phrase of, “Read more”, whilst providing a link phrase of, “Read more about the origins of lemons”, which makes perfect sense when read out of context for all other user agents. The following image shows what is presented to a JAWS user using the above example:  General Context This technique isn’t just limited to providing context for link phrases. It can also be used to provide context for any element that, for whatever reason, is not intended to be rendered visually. For example, a design might not include headings, but headings are essential for screen users to understand the structure of a document. The context class can be applied to hidden heading elements, but the selector would have to be renamed from span.context to either *.context or just plain .context so that the class may be used by any element. Structure isn’t just useful to screen reader users, but can also be essential for other users. For example, heading text can be helpful for people with cognitive impairments to understand the structure of a document. In these cases, hiding context should be the last option.  Opera doesn’t work with screen readers – does it matter?  Posted on Friday, 14 October 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   One thing that should be obvious to anybody who has read my recent posts Rough Guide: browsers, operating systems and screen reader support and a Brief history of browser accessibility support or looked at HTML5Accessibility.com is that the Opera browser does not have practical support for screen readers. Of the big 5 browsers, it is the only one that does not work well with screen reading software on at least one platform. The question is, does it matter?  There are already browsers available that provide good access for screen reader users. Does the Opera browser offer any unique features that would be valuable to users who are also screen reader users? Does the Opera browser offer any unique features that would be valuable to users of other assistive technology (screen magnfiers for example) that they cannot currently access, because of Opera’s lack of accessibility API support? Does Opera the company have any duty to ensure assistive technology users can use its software? Does it make good business sense for Opera to make its products accessible to screen reader users? The apparent answer is that those who make such decisions have not thought it so for the past 15 years.  Note: This is not in any way an attempt at Opera bashing. I like the Opera browser,  it’s my browser of choice on iPhone. I like the people who I know that work for Opera, I am just writing down some thoughts and hopefully other people will chime in on the question “does it matter” as it’s one I ask myself and keep coming back to particularly since publishing Freedom of Choice last year.  HTML5 Accessibility Chops: the alt decision  Posted on Wednesday, 27 April 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   A recent decision by the W3C HTML working group has caused much discussion and some consternation within the accessibility community and wider web development community.  If you want change get involved! As per W3C policy the decision made by the HTML working group is not the end of the road. It can be re-opened or a formal objection can be lodged. Both of these options are being actively pursued by the HTML working group accessibility taskforce. Anybody can join the HTML working group and participate in the continuing development of HTML5 and beyond. Also the HTML5 specification will be going into Last Call next month, at this stage public comment will be invited. But you can comment on the spec at any time using the form at the top of the spec or via the public mailing list. What does the decision mean? The presence of aria-labelledby does not make missing alt conforming: HTML validators WILL flag this as an error: <img src=\"chart.gif\" aria-labelledby=\"a1\"> <p id=\"a1\">description of data in chart</p> The presence of role=presentation does not make missing alt conforming. HTML5 validators WILL flag this as an error: <img src=\"spacer.gif\" role=\"presentation\"> The presence of <meta name=generator> makes missing alt conforming. HTML5 validators WILL NOT flag this as an error: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head>  <title>photos</title>  <meta name=generator> </head> <body> <img src=\"dsksk231.jpg\"> </body> </html> The presence of title makes missing alt conforming. HTML5 validators WILL NOT flag this as an error: <img src=\"chart.gif\" title=\"poot\"> The presence of figcaption makes missing alt conforming. HTML5 validators WILL NOT flag this as an error: <figure> <img src=\"dsksk231.jpg\"> <figcaption>photo dsksk231.jpg</figcaption> </figure> The decision The decision is long, multi-faceted and complex, reading it in a plain text email I found problematic so I have produced an HTML version of the W3C HTML working group decision on alt validity requirements. NOTE: The text has been re-ordered the first 3 sections below “Decision of the Working Group”, “Appealing this Decision” and “Revisiting the Issue” are at the end of the text in the original document. They are placed at the top here, as they provide a summary of the decision and what can be done to change the decision. Decision of the Working Group Therefore, the HTML Working Group hereby decides that:  The presence of aria-labelledby does not make missing alt conforming. The presence of role=presentation does not make missing alt conforming. The presence of <meta name=generator> makes missing alt conforming. Use of private communications does not, in itself, make missing alt conforming. The presence of title makes missing alt conforming. The presence of figcaption makes missing alt conforming.  The two Change Proposals closest to these results are those identified as Requirement Set 1 and Requirement Set 4: These Change Proposals agree with each other and with the WG decision on aria-labeldby, role=presentation and figcaption. On the generator mechanism and the title attribute, Requirement Set 1 aligns with the WG decision: On the email exception, Requirement Set 4 aligns with the WG decision: Thus, overall, the WG adopts the Requirement Set 1 proposal with regards to aria-labelledby, role=presentation, <meta name=generator>, title and figcaption; but Requirement Set 4 with regards to the email exception. Appealing this Decision If anyone strongly disagrees with the content of the decision and would like to raise a Formal Objection, they may do so at this time. Formal Objections are reviewed by the Director in consultation with the Team. Ordinarily, Formal Objections are only reviewed as part of a transition request. Revisiting this Issue This issue can be reopened if new information comes up. Examples of possible relevant new information include:  Use cases that specifically require the use of aria-labelledby with alt omitted. Use cases that specifically require the use of role=presentation with alt omitted. Examples of authors mistakenly or deliberately omitting alt when they might have otherwise, due to the generator mechanism exception. Evidence that a great number of authoring tools are making wide use of the generator exemption, and that this interferes with proper inclusion of alt. (A list of possible generator values was provided in a Change Proposal, but there was no explanation of where it came from. Testing of content generators or direct statements of intent from implementors would provide sufficient evidence.) A demonstrated trend towards more authoring tools fully supporting ATAG2, including the requirement to prompt for textual equivalents for images. Examples of actual users who hand-author HTML emails incorporating images, and would find it overly burdensome to include alt. Examples of other uses for the private communication exemption that are not covered by other exemptions. Evidence that the number of implementations exposing title in an accessible way is decreasing, or that some existing implementations are unwilling or unable to expose it in an accessible way. Evidence that implementations are unwilling or unable to expose the figcaption association to assistive technologies.  The decision in detail The decision follows. The chairs made an effort to explicitly address all arguments presented in the Change Proposals on this topic in addition to arguments posted as objections in the poll. Question before the Working Group There is a basic disagreement in the group on the validity requirements for alt. The result was two issues, six change proposals, and a straw poll for objections: 2 issues  http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/31 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/tracker/issues/80  6 change proposals  http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2010Jul/0050.html http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/ImgElement20090126 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/ImgElement20100706 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/ImgElement20100707 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/ImgElement20100510 http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/ImgElement20100504  1 straw poll  http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/issue-31-80-validation-objection-poll/results  Note: other aspects of these issues included other Change Proposals and led to separate polls. Points in Dispute Six separate markup features were proposed as possible exemptions to the general requirement to specify an alt attribute. In other words, for each construct, there was a proposal that it is a conforming replacement for alt. Each proposal had separate pro and con arguments, but the structure of each dispute was broadly similar:  For each construct, some argued that there is a valid use case for allowing this particular exemption, which cannot be satisfied in any other way. In many cases, the validity of proposed use cases was disputed. It was argued that the use case is improper or should not be served. In many cases, there were objections based on redundancy; it was claimed that other mechanisms can serve the same use cases. Notwithstanding use cases, many objections indicated that Omitting alt may have negative consequences, and that tese could be worse than the consequences of denying a use case.  These lines of argument all have some validity. However, for the various proposed exemptions, the balance of the arguments was affected by the specific details of that exemption. The Chairs made an effort to evaluate the arguments in a consistent way. In particular, if strong objections establish a valid, non-redundant use case for omitting alt in a specific case, even after accounting for objections based on validity or redundancy, then the bar for negative consequences was fairly high. The negative consequences claimed would have to constitute stronger objections than objections based on failing to serve the use case. On the other hand, if no valid use cases were established for a particular case of omitting alt, or if there were strong objections based on validity or redundancy, then the bar for negative consequences was fairly low. Even relatively weak objections based on negative consequences could prevail in such a case. Examining the individual questions: Should it be permitted to omit alt when an aria-labelledby attribute is specified? At least one Change Proposal argued that when the aria-labelledby attribute is specified, it should be permitted to omit the alt attribute. A Change Proposal argued that aria-labelledby has a valid use case: For visual users an image can have an implied label due to proximity and placement in relation to the image. The aria-labelledby attribute provides a method to explicitly associate a text alternative with an image, like the alt attribute. The difference being that the text is available to all by default facilitating universal design. This technique would be especially useful for image galleries with the developer adding the aria-labelledby attribute to the template. Author adding a text alternative via a text field. No one disputed the need to serve these use cases. Thus, the need to serve these use cases was established as valid and could potentially make for a strong objection. However, one survey comment argued (paraphrasing) that it’s not necessary to allow missing alt when aria-labelledby is also specified; authors already have options that satisfy these use cases. Furthermore, responses on other survey questions proposed figcaption to serve similar use cases. No one disputed the claims of redundancy. Thus, the arguments based on redundancy are a strong objection. Overall, then, while omitting alt when aria-labelledby is specified was found to have valid use cases, it was also found to be redundant with other constructs. Therefore, the bar for establishing negative consequences is low in this case. Attention then turns to whether there are negative consequences omitting alt when aria-labelledby is specified. One argument was that it’s problematic to let ARIA affect the conformance of non-ARIA constructs: The aria-labelledby=”” attribute should be allowed, but should not affect conformance criteria of non-ARIA content since ARIA is only an annotation mechanism for accessibility APIs. And similarly: Not having any mention of technologies from other layers, e.g. ARIA or RDFa, prevents layering violations and avoids abusing annotation technologies for core conformance. These objections lacked specifics on the harm that would be caused, so was relatively weak, but no one disputed them. To permit the omission of @alt because there is @aria-labelledby, is a permission to omit the @alt of a non-presentational image. I believe there should never be permission to drop @alt on any non-presentational image as it represents a complication of the rules that authors have to cope with… This objection is moderate in strength. Complexity is a valid objection to features that have no valid, unique use cases. Although the objections based on negative consequences ranged from relatively weak to moderately strong, aria-labelledby was established to be redundant, and so the bar for negative consequences was low. Therefore, on balance, the proposal to still require alt when aria-labelledby is specified drew weaker objections, compared to the proposal to allow alt to be omitted when aria-labelledby is present. Specific problems of varying severity were identified. Combined with the fact that omitting alt when aria-labelledby is specified was found to be redundant for its use cases, this constitutes a strong objection. Should it be permitted to omit alt when role=presentation is specified? At least one Change Proposal argued that when the role attribute is specified with a value of “presentation”, it should be permitted to omit the alt attribute. The case for allowing role=presentation to replace alt was relatively limited: Why allow role=”presentation” to act as an alternative to alt=””? It is specified and implemented to do what alt=”” is specified to do. It is non specific, it works on all elements. As per the rules specified in current spec pertaining to its use [24], the use of role=”presentation” is not dis-allowed on the img element it is in fact stated that it is the only role that can be applied to an img that has an alt=””… This was the only argument presented, and it does not seem to state a use case that specifically requires role=presentation instead of alt with an empty value. It argues that the role=presentation exemption *could* be allowed, but it doesn’t make the case that it *should* be allowed, or that there is any problem caused by disallowing. Thus, this was taken to be a weak objection. Since no effective case was made that omitting alt when role=presentation is specified has a non-redundant, valid use case, the bar for establishing negative consequences was extremely low. A number of Change Proposal and survey comments objected to allowing alt to be left off when role=presentation is specified. One comment argued that this state is self-contradictory: I object to allowing role=”presentation” to be specified without an alt=”” attribute because it would allow a state that is contradictory. Making a page self-contradictory is an authoring mistake. Authoring conformance criteria should help authors catch mistakes. This objection was moderately weak, as it lacks detail. Why is it self-contradictory to allow role=”presentation” without an alt=”” attribute, but apparently not self-contradictory to allow alt=”” without role=”presentation”? On the other hand, no one disputed this argument. Another comment objected to the role=presentation exemption on the basis of simplicity: We should have a simple rule that img role requires a empty @alt when the role is presentational, regardless of whether the presentational role is explicit or implicit. And another objection along similar lines also argued for a simpler rule: By permitting role=presentation as a full replacement for the empty alt, we – for no good reason – takes away the focus on correct use of @alt, and this – in a situation where @role can *help authors* to use @alt as intended. By insisting that there must be an empty alt even when there is a role=presentation, we are consequent with regard to what has been the rule until now. We are stable. These objections are moderate in strength. Complexity is a valid objection to features that have no valid, unique use cases. Another objection (framed as a positive effect for a different proposal) made a point related to simplicity, namely that ARIA should not affect the non-ARIA validation rules: Not having any mention of technologies from other layers, e.g. ARIA or RDFa, prevents layering violations and avoids abusing annotation technologies for core conformance. This was taken to be a weak objection in itself, since it presents no details of the claimed layering violations or abuse. However, the following comment provides more detail on the problems that could be created by such layering violations: Lack of @alt in combination with role=presentation, in general poses no issue to sighted users, unless the @src URL is rotten or image display is not supported or temporarily disabled (during page load). In that case, then user agents generates replacement text such as [image] for the lacking alt. Sighted users are able to live with this, although they may perceive the image to be an important one rather than a presentational one, and if there are many, it disturbs. Users may see the @alt text while the page loads etc. Should validation ignore such issues? I don’t think so. By setting the role to “presentation”, these problems are hidden from users of ARIA supporting AT. And this fine. However validators should help authors. More precisely they should help them to care for also those user groups that are disturbed by the lack of empty @alt on presentational images and also to avoid visual annoyance that they themselves may care for. And it should help authors to author consequent markup. And should therefore complain about the lack of an empty @alt for images with role=presentation. This is a moderately strong objection. It provides specific examples of the problems that could be created by specifying role=presentation without explicitly specifying empty alt=””. This is somewhat weakened by the fact that these problems are mostly minor and only affect edge cases. Yet another objection argues: Consider a GUI authoring tool used by end-users, not professional Web developers or content authors. Such tools generate <img> elements, but it is not always appropriate for such tools to pause and demand alt text from the user before continuing. Expecting such a tool to generate role=presentation instead of its current behavior (generating no alt attribute) results in unnecessarily verbose markup for no additional benefit. This objection seems somewhat tangential to the point, but is taken as weak supporting evidence that there is not a strong use case for role=presentation without alt being specified. Although the objections based on negative consequences ranged from weak to only moderately strong, omitting alt when role=presentation is specified was not found to have any valid, non-redundant use cases, and so the bar for negative consequences was extremely low. Overall, the proposal to still require alt when role=presentation is specified drew weaker objections, compared to the proposal to allow alt to be omitted when role=presentation is present. Specific problems of varying severity were identified. Combined with the fact that there was no clearly identified use case that specifically required use of role=presentation without alt, this constitutes an overall strong objection. Should it be permitted to omit alt when the generator mechanism is present? At least one Change Proposal argued that when a page is created by an automated content generation tool, and that tool indicates this using <meta name=generator>, it should be permitted to omit the alt attribute. It was argued that there was a valid use case for the generator exemption, namely automated content generators which cannot produce alt themselves and for various reasons cannot or will not demand alt from the user. The following objection, though entered for role=presentation, directly argues one such use case: Consider a GUI authoring tool used by end-users, not professional Web developers or content authors. Such tools generate <img> elements, but it is not always appropriate for such tools to pause and demand alt text from the user before continuing. Several objectors cited this use case, and further pointed out that if content generators are forced to generate nonconforming markup to satisfy this use case, they may instead enter bogus alt values, which would merely exacerbate the problem: If an authoring tool or other generator does not have sufficient information to include either alternative text or a caption, there is nothing the tool can do. If we say that in those cases the authoring tool would be non-conforming if it didn’t provide alternative text or a caption, then the tool will just provide bogus (placebo) alt=”” attribute values, which just makes the problem non-machine-detectable instead. To address this, therefore, we should allow generator tools to include images without alternative text or captions if absolutely necessary. Also: I object to treating the absence of the alt attribute as a validation error when the generator mechanism is used, because if it is treated as an error in that case, generator developers are incented to generate bogus values in order to make their products emit markup that doesn’t trigger errors. (There are always generator developers who want to make the output of their programs validate.) The use case of GUI tools that do not prompt for alt seems well established. Some disputed the validity of the use case. For example, it was argued that: Application developers should follow ATAG http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/ However, it’s clear that there are tools which do not follow ATAG in this respect, and no evidence was provided that this would change. A more detailed form of this argument was also made: When an authoring tool doesn’t have anything useful to put in for the alt text, the tool shouldn’t put anything in. A good authoring tool will check for missing alt text and offer to assist the user in repairing the content. If an author is adamant they’re not going to provide alt text, there is no requirement that says the authoring tool should provide it in place of the author. In fact, it’s just the opposite, as the authoring tool could not possibly know the author’s intent. In this scenario, the authoring tool should not include the alt attribute at all, and the resulting markup should be considered invalid. It should be considered invalid because it is inaccessible, and not perceivable by some people. If the tool allows alt text to be provided, then the tool would be considered compliant (on this particular issue), even though the resulting markup would not be compliant, as the user chose not to make the content compliant. This argument is based on what tools *should* do, but in practice often don’t. Since no evidence was provided that common practice is changing, this was taken to be a weak objection. Another commenter makes the case more explicitly: Unfortunately, despite what the specification says, users will consider an authoring tool non-conforming (buggy) if the documents it outputs are not flagged as conforming by validators.Therefore we need a way for validators and authoring tools to coordinate so that validators will not criticise conforming authoring tools when a problem (in this case missing alternative text) is the user’s fault and not the author tool’s. The simplest solution here is to reuse the existing document-wide flag that indicates that a document was created by an authoring tool, and have conformance checkers silently ignore the missing alternative text in that situation (or at least phrase the error in a way to indicate that the authoring tool is not to blame). Once again, this argument didn’t give specific examples of the claimed bad incentive, so it was relatively weak. It is noteworthy however that several respondents took this incentive structure as a given, and none denied that it exists. After considering all these arguments, it seems established that there is a valid use case for allowing the alt attribute to be omitted when the generator mechanism is specified. This use case makes for a moderately strong objection. However, the claim of negative consequences to disallowing this use case was somewhat weakened by the lack of concrete evidence that bogus values have been used in the past or would be used in the future. So overall, this makes for a medium objection. Some of the objections based on validity could also, in theory, be interpreted as objections based on redundancy. In particular, arguing that authoring tools should just generate invalid content seems to argue that producing invalid content is sufficient to address the use case.However, since the question is one of conformance for authors and authoring tools, generating invalid markup does not seem to be a full alternative solution to the use case. Related to redundancy, it was also argued that if alt may be omitted when the generator mechanism is used, then the email and private communication exemption would be rendered largely redundant. In fact, this was the strongest objection to the email and private communications exception. As a result, accepting the generator exemption would allow us to reject another exemption. This constitutes an additional moderately strong objection. Thus, overall, the objection based on use cases for the generator mechanism was taken to be a medium objection. It’s validity was disputed, but these objections were outweighed by those that argued for its validity. It’s non-redundancy was also disputed, but such objections were found to be weak. Thus, overall, the bar for establishing negative consequences is intermediate between high and low. Some argued that omitting alt and using the generator mechanism had harmful consequences: Hence, the generator mechanism should not have any bearing on the @alt requirements as the generator string/mechanism has no bearing on the attributes of the <img> or the context in which the img appears in. The negative effects of omission of an empty or non-empty @alt are in no way made up for by the presence of the generator mechanism. This statement in itself lacks specifics, but there were some concrete arguments supporting the case for negative consequences: The generator mechanism facilitates the creation of inaccessible content. No evidence was provided that more inaccessible content would be created if the generator exemption is allowed than otherwise. So this was taken to be a weak objection. A list was provided of example <meta generator> values, and from this a conclusion was drawn that a tremendous amount of Web content would make use of the generator exemption. However, it’s not clear where this list came from. It is not present in the spec, and does not seem to align with the spec’s definition of a content generator. In particular, it includes many text editors which do not seem to qualify as automated markup generators. Was this list derived from the output of actual authoring tools? Was it found by looking at real Web content? In the absence of information about where this list came from, it was taken to have no evidentiary value. Another objection was based on the possibility of authoring mistakes: The generator mechanism is actively harmful to accessibility. If the generator option is left at document level, it would be far too easy for authors to have the software automatically insert “generator” and then forget to provide any text alternatives for images. If supported by concrete evidence, this would have been a strong objection. This seems like a plausible authoring mistake which would have negative consequences. But it was weakened by lack of any specific evidence that this problem has actually occurred in practice. This provision has been in HTML WG Editor’s Drafts and Working Drafts since September 3, 2009. This should be enough time to see at least anecdotal evidence of the claimed problem. Even though normally lack of supporting evidence would render an objection weak, in this case, there is a plausible-sounding argument even in the absence of evidence, so the objection based on authoring mistakes is overall taken as moderately weak. Yet another objection was based on standards and guidelines: The generator mechanism breaks standards and guidelines requiring text equivalents on an individual element basis. Many specific standards and guidelines were listed. However, these guidelines were generally created before the generator mechanism exemption was invented, so it’s not clear if the disagreement indicates a problem, or just failure to update. Thus, this was taken to be a weak objection. Another objection was that the generator exemption breaks the structure of the img element: Requiring a set of programmatically determinable valid options helps ensure that images have complete structure. Complete structure of the <img> element requires both src and text alternatives. This claim seems to be based on a circular argument. Omitting alt should not be allowed, because that would make the img element have incomplete structure, because img requires alt. Thus, the objection fails to make its case and was given no weight. Another objection argues that the generator mechanism fails to have certain benefits: The generator mechanism does not improve user experience or the chances of accessible content being produced. It does not help authors catch mistakes. It does not help educate developers. No one disputed this argument; but conversely, no one argued that generator has these benefits or should be allowed because of such benefits. With no concrete argument as to why the generator exception ought to have these benefits, this was taken to be a weak objection. An argument was made that the sole benefit of the generator mechanism exemption would be one that may not be desirable: The only benefit is that most tool vendors will automatically adhere to HTML5, as very few adhere to existing standards. The exception is a way to codify and bless bad tools. No evidence was provided that the other claimed benefits (e.g. avoiding the creation of perverse incentives to include bogus alt) would not materialize, thus, this claim based on “the only benefit” was taken as a weak objection. A further objection based on the blind photographer use case was entered; however, that use case was not claimed for this particular mechanism. That objection was instead applied to mechanisms where it is relevant (title and figcaption), and was given no weight for this question. Overall, there were many claimed disadvantages that flow from the generator exception, ranging from weak to moderately weak. They were generally unsupported by details or concrete evidence. Even though the use case for omitting alt when the generator mechanism is used was disputed and only found to be a medium objection, it still outweighs these claimed disadvantages, as they were all found to be weak or moderately weak. Thus, on the whole, the proposal to allow alt to be omitted when the generator mechanism is used was found to draw weaker objections, compared to the proposal to still require alt, even when the generator mechanism is used. Should it be permitted to omit alt in email or other private communications? At least one Change Proposal argued that when content comprises email or other private communications, it should be permitted to omit the alt attribute. The use case was expounded at some length, giving the example of a complex image in private e-mail: 3. PRIVATE USE: In some cases, extremely complex images may be sent from one user to another as part of a private HTML document or HTML e-mail. Such images may be so complex that writing useful alternative text would be a significant endeavour of its own, tantamount to recasting the entire image as text. Ordinarily, that work would be worth the effort, since not all users are able to see the images; the specification should in fact require that work ordinarily. However, we would be ignored (and likely ridiculed) if we required people to write such text in the case of private HTML documents or HTML e-mails amongst users who know each other and are aware of each other’s abilities (both technical and physical) to access visual images. Therefore we should have an exception in the requirements for this specific case. … Now, we do not want conformance checkers to “allow” anyone to omit alternative text just in case they are in this situation, so we should further constrain conformance checkers to not allow this unless they have been specifically configured. If we fail to do this, we would undermine the entire attempt at making pages more accessible by requiring alternative text for images in the normal case. Furthering this argument, it was claimed that alt is often unnecessary in private communications, and would be omitted anyway, and therefore the spec should not make a requirement that would not be followed: It makes no sense to require an author to provide content in two forms (image and text) when one of those forms can be handled by the entire target audience for the content. (A requirement requiring that one’s wife write a description of every photo sent to one’s husband is just going to be ignored, so there’s no point having such a requirement.) Others argued that, since people engaged in private communication would disregard the alt requirement anyway, no provision needs to be made for it: Private situation does not need to be mentioned in the spec, just as copyright licenses typically do not mention what the user is authorized by law to do in private with the said thing. Man and wife do not validate before they communicate with each others. It improves nothing to put this particular exception in the spec – in instead creates an *artificial* permission which really doesn’t permit anything: It is similar to adding restrictions or rights which the copyright holder nevertheless cannot whether permit or restrict this right. Similarly: It is an author’s prerogative not to provide text alternatives for images because they’re writing for themselves, close friends or relatives. However, a HTML <img> element without both src and text alternative is still not complete. Therefore, it should not be considered valid. These were taken to be an objections based on validity or redundancy (it’s not clear which was intended). Arguing that something should be allowed because people will do it anyway seems like a marginally stronger objection than arguing that something need not be allowed because people will disregard the spec. The set of valid use cases has generally been taken to be a strong influence on what markup should be conforming. For one specific form of the use case, specifically the case where a complex image requires a long description, validity was was disputed: Regarding Proposal 1’s statement about a complex image use case in an email, it is not applicable. ISSUE 31- missing alt is about short text alternatives not long ones. No one expects a long description for alt text. In fact that would be incorrect. Complex images would be covered by ISSUE 30- Longdesc. Since longdesc is not currently allowed, per WG decision, this does not seem like a relevant objection. Further, complex images requiring long descriptions were not the only use case cited. So this was taken to be a weak objection. Examining the question of redundancy, one commenter wrote: Consider the same sort of GUI authoring tool I described above, [..] For such tools, this option is essentially redundant with the generator exception option. If both of these exceptions were allowed, we would prefer tools to use the generator mechanism. That leaves the use case of hand-authored content in private communication, which doesn’t seem common enough for the spec to explicitly address. This objection argues that the private communication exemption is largely redundant if the generator exemption is allowed. Looking into the matter deeper, no one specifically claimed a personal interest in hand-authoring private communications in HTML format without specifying alt. Nor did anyone claim interest in implementing a validator feature to implement a special “private communications” mode. This strengthens the claim that the true core of the use case is covered by the generator exception. Thus, while the private communication exception was established to have a valid use case via marginally strong objections, this was greatly weakened by the objection that most of the use case, and perhaps nearly all in practice, is sufficiently well served by another mechanism. Therefore, the bar for objections based on negative consequences was low. On the topic of harm following from this exception, somer argued that senders or recipients of private communication may derive ancillary benefits from including alt: And it is not a future proof rule: users keep e-mail archives for years. One never knows: after agreeing to not include an alt, the receiver may turn blind, he/she may unexpectedly be hindered from using a graphical e-mail program and the sender himself/herself may loose the image (because the program allows to delete attachments) etc. And similarly: Sighted recipients. They: May have a slow connection and turn off images to speed download. May have an expensive data roaming connection (that is not slow). May have images turned off to decrease bandwidth use in order to lower their Internet usage fees. May have a text-only user agent. May be listening to the page being read out by a voice browser or other voice output, for example, as they drive or otherwise cannot read the web page. This was taken to be a moderately weak objection, since the writers of this objections also claimed that people could disregard the rule in private communication, even if it made their content non-conforming. This undermines the premise that these benefits are so compelling, that senders of private emails must be required to specify alt. However, this was not as weak as some other objections, since specifics were provided. Others argued that allowing this exemption would encourage seeking of loopholes: Further more, it encourages authors to look for loopholes. This was taken to be weak, because no specifics were provided. It was also claimed that the private communication exception discriminates: The email exception spec text profiles, targets, and discriminates between people on the basis of ability or disability. However, no specific evidence was given that this provision is discriminatory. So this was taken to be a weak objection. Another objection was on the basis of structural integrity. The email exception mechanism breaks the structural integrity of the <img> element. This linked the same argument as for the generator exemption, that omitting alt breaks structural integrity because alt is required. Once again, it was given no weight. The objections to allowing alt to be omitted in private communications based on negative consequences ranged from weak to moderately weak. However, because the omitting alt in this case was identified as redundant, the bar for claims of negative consequences was low. Even moderately weak objections are sufficient. Thus, overall, the proposal to require alt even in private communications and email (if none of the other exemptions applies) was found to draw weaker objections than the proposal to allow alt to be omitted in all cases in private communications. Should it be permitted to omit alt when the title attribute is specified? At least one Change Proposal argued that when an image has a title attribute specified, it should be permitted to omit the alt attribute. Change proposals and poll responses argued that there are valid use cases for the title exemption. One use case proposed is that of content authors who cannot provide a true textual equivalent, but can provide a caption; one specific example was blind photographers: If an author is unable to include alternative text (e.g. they are a blind photographer), then they should still be required to include _some_ information, which could include the image’s caption. The caption belongs in the title=”” attribute or in <figcaption>. And similarly: 2. EQUALITY: There are certain edge cases where a page producer must reference an image without knowing what the image is. Such a producer cannot, by definition, provide a textual alternative to the image: they do not know what the image is. One example of this would be a blind photographer who has taken a hundred photos during a vacation, without keeping track of any information as to when or where each photo was taken. Faced with these one hundred JPEG images and the desire to write an HTML Web page that exposes those images, the photographer has no ability to provide alternative text. This seems like a strong objection to dropping both the title and figcaption exemptions; though it does not clearly establish that both need to be allowed. An opposed objection argues that this use case is redundant, because it is satisfied by blind photographers or others in this situation creating nonconforming content: The blind photographer use case in Proposal 1 is a red herring. A blind photographer is not prohibited from publishing photos without text alternatives. They are perfectly free to do so. But no matter if a photographer is sighted or not, if that photographer does not provide a text alternative for an <img> element, it doesn’t change two facts:  The <img> element is still incomplete. A blind USER cannot perceive a photo without a text alternative, even if a blind photographer takes it.   It is true that there are constructs in HTML5 that “work” (in the sense that they have a particular effect), even though they are not “conforming”. However, in general, the rules for content conformance have been treated in decisions as being driven largely by the set of valid use cases for authors. The argument that authors could simply create nonconforming content appears to concede the validity of the use case and was thus taken as a weak objection. A further claimed use case was distinguishing advisory information from textual equivalents: Advisory information (what title=”” contains) is generally different from textual equivalents (what alt=”” contains). That said, user agents could expose such content to the A11Y layer in such cases, and this is clearly better than not exposing such content. As such, we support permitting such markup. Since this lacked specific examples of when such a distinction is needed, it was taken to be a relatively weak objection. However, this objection was not seriously disputed. A comment apparently in opposition to allowing title said: Authors are advised to only use the title attribute for “additional information” and not as a full equivalent alternative. Yet this only seems to reinforce the premise that there is a distinction between the two, and thus was taken as an even weaker objection. There were no further objections to validity of these use cases. One might wonder: since the use cases for omitting alt when title is specified are described as being served by either title or figcaption, is it necessary to allow omitting alt in both cases, or only for one of these constructs? However, both advocates and opponents of these mechanisms pointed out important and relevant differences in behavior. In any case, no objection was made on the grounds of redundancy between these features. Nor was any specific reason given to pick one or the other. Thus, the use cases for title were not found to be redundant. On the whole then, strong objections establish that omitting alt when title is specified has valid, non-redundant use cases. Therefore, the bar for objections based on negative consequences is high. Examining the claims of negative consequences, some argued that allowing alt to be omitted when title is title specified is problematic, because the title attribute is fundamentally not accessible: The title attribute is not an acceptable text alternative as it’s content is not displayed to the user unless they can use a mouse and beforehand know the content is there. The content of the image title attribute is also often not detected by AT by default unless the user makes an explicit choice in their preferences to announce the attribute contents. Similarly: To reflect the unsuitability of title attribute content to act as a caption when a text alternative is not available, as the content is not displayed to the user unless they can use a mouse and they know the content is there.Refer to Issue 80 for more detail. And furthermore: The title attribute has been around for over 10 years and it has never been implemented in a way that would make it a suitable substitute for alt attribute content, and there is no sign from implementors that this situation will change. Also: The specification forbids user agents from displaying title attribute content in the same way it displays alt attribute content: “The alt attribute does not represent advisory information. User agents must not present the contents of the alt attribute in the same way as content of the title attribute.” This constraint makes it even less likely that at some point in the future a critical mass of browsers will implement title attribute such that its content will be displayed in a manner that provides equivalent access to the content for all users. Though somewhat tricky to follow, the following passage implies that in at least some assistive technologies, the contents of the title attribute *are* exposed, in an accessible way: What we *should* avoid is the the situation we have in the W3 HTML4 validation service today: there it is permitted to combine empty @alt with a non-empty @title: <img src=img alt=”” title=”Lorem ipsum.” > VoiceOver, in accordance with my Validity map, treats this example as non-presentational. And, again in accordance with my Validity map, the @alt should therefore at contain an @alt, since the @alt should reflect the role of the <img>. Note that VoiceOver makes no big difference between @alt=”<empty>” and no alt at all. Thus, as far as VoiceOVer is concerned, the need for a non-empty @alt should not only be seen as an accessibility but just as much as a simple rule for authors to follow! This was combined with a second-hand report, lacking specifics, that other assistive technology products would not do so: However, reportedly, in other AT than VoiceOver, the lack of @alt in an <img> which has a non-empty @title, creates more or less the same problems whether or not @title is lacking, even if some very (conscious) AT user may get help from @title if they enable support for it. This is an *accessibility* reason to require an @alt even if the <img> has a @title. Since at least one product is known from testing to expose title=”” in an accessible way, and since no evidence was provided that other products cannot or will not do so, the objection that title is an inaccessible mechanism was taken to be a weak objection. The claim that it can’t or won’t be exposed in an accessible way is outweighed by the concrete example of it being exposed in an accessible way. A more subtle objection was the claim that, since many products do not yet expose title in an accessible way, that it is problematic to use it now: Encouraging use of the title attribute before it is implemented in an accessible way does a disservice to users with disabilities. Not much evidence was provided that this cannot or will not change, however. At least one product is already known to expose title in an accessible way, and others were reported to do so as an option. Thus, this was also taken as a weak objection. Another argument claims that authors may simply specify title and then neglect to specify alt, even if a proper text alternative *is* known: Suggesting that the title is an adequate substitute may encourage authors to not provide a text alternative using the alt attribute as conformance checkers will not flag the absence of the alt attribute as an issue. No specific evidence was presented that this would occur, so this was taken to be a weak objection. Another objection argued: Also, an empty @alt should together with a non-empty @atitle should count as *invalid* since the sighted would perceive such an image as non-presentational. However, this objection failed to explain why the situation described would be a problem, so it was taken to be weak. Thus, overall, the objections based on problems created by omitting alt when title is specified were found to be weak. But omitting alt when title is specified was found to serve valid, non-redundant use cases. Thus, overall, the proposal to allow alt to be omitted when title is specified was found to draw weaker objections than the proposal to still require alt when title is specified. Should it be permitted to omit alt when the image is in a figure with a figcaption? At least one Change Proposal argued that when an image is inside a figure element with a figcaption specified, it should be permitted to omit the alt attribute. The same use cases were claimed for the figcaption exemption as for the title exemption. For brevity we do not repeat them here, but we note that overall they were found to constitute strong objections. It might be argued that this makes figcaption and title redundant mechanisms, however, both advocates and opponents of these mechanisms pointed out important and relevant differences in behavior. In any case, no objection was made on the grounds of redundancy between these features. Thus, as with title, omitting alt when a figcaption is used was found to have valid, non-redundant use cases. Thus, the bar for claims of negative consequences was high. One claimed problem with allowing the figcaption exemption was the figure/figcaption association is not present in current assistive technology products: … based on today’s user agents and AT this is a relationship that is unsupported by AT. We should define this use case, and thus allow AT to use <figcaption> as a label for the image. However, this lacked specifics on what products were tested. No evidence was provided that such products would not support the relatively new figcaption feature in the future. And it concedes that the use case is valid. Thus, this was taken to be a weak objection. Another argument claims that that some placeholder alt value could be included when figcaption provides a caption: There is little reason to permit the dropping of the @alt when there is a figcaption. The author can just as well identify the image with a short text such “photo” or “figure”, “diagram” or – even – whitespace inside the @alt as this has the same effect and is fast and quick for the author (but whitespace would probably make it invisible to text browsers so this is no good advice – though, not everyone obeys this but treat it as no-alt and generates an @alt text.). Since user agents may repair the lack of @alt if the author doesn’t add it, and this yet another reason for the same. It is nice and well if the figcaption provides a label/caption for the image. However, it is a complicating rule to say that one may drop the @alt. This argument claims that alt could be provided anyway, even if the primary text to expose is a caption in figcaption. However, no argument is given for why the particular examples chosen (e.g. alt containing only whitespace) are superior to omitting alt and relying on the caption. In fact, one respondent claimed that such a requirement would be excessive: I object to requiring the presence of the alt attribute when the image is in a figure with figcaption, because excessive requirements will be perceived to lower the seriousness of all requirements and requiring information that authors are likely to consider duplicate information is likely to be perceived as an excessive requirement. This was found to be a stronger objection than the objection that the figcaption exception is unnecessary. Another objection raised the possibility of multiple images in a single figcaption: One thing to consider, as well, is that we are likely to see many instances when there is more than the image inside the figure – perhaps there is some text there, or two images. What then? Authors are likely to not discern between the one image use case and more-than-just-an-image use case very well. (May be it also isn’t necessary to discern so much – but this remains to be tested.) No evidence was provided that multiple images in a single figure has created a problem in practice, so this was taken to be a weak objection. Another respondent argued that figcaption was a sufficient replacement for alt: I do not object to the figcaption being permitted without an alt attribute, as it can act as a mechanism to associate a text alternative with an image when the text is appropriate to be viewed in conjunction with the display of the image or when an text alternative has not yet been provided via the alt attribute. However, this comment does not seem to comprise an objection either way, so it was given no weight. All objections based on negative consequences of allowing alt to be omitted when figcaption is used were found to be weak. The bar established by use cases was high. Therefore, in summary, the proposal to allow alt to be omitted on images inside a <figure> element with a <figcaption> drew weaker objections, compared to the proposal to still require alt in this case. There was no objection to the claim that figcaption has valid use cases, and little or no specific harm was identified. Next Steps Bug 8646 is to be REOPENED and marked as WGDecision. Since the combination of prevailing Change Proposals does call for a spec change, the editor is hereby directed to make the changes in accordance with the Decision of the Working Group above. Once those changes, as well as changes for the other surveys on these issues, are complete, ISSUE-31 and ISSUE-80 are to be marked as CLOSED. Arguments not considered However, we should not do this as an attribute on each <img> element, since doing that would make it far more likely that authors will abuse the mechanism to shut up validators raising completely valid problems. Therefore we should limit this mechanism to page-wide “generator” meta tags. No proposal was made to make the generator mechanism per element, so this was disregarded. If any generated or missing mechanism is included in HTML5, it should only be included at the element level where it could be dealt with on an image-by-image case with a detection method such as a generated or missing attribute, rather than at the document level. Disregarded for the same reason. Additionally, some arguments were presented that a generator mechanism either should or shouldn’t be at the element level rather than the document level. But since no Change Proposal actually proposed this, arguments for or against this position were disregarded. As Al Gilman said on behalf of PF,”WCAG WG is chartered to set Accessibility guidelines and HTML WG is not; so HTML5 should be careful to supply features that support WCAG and describe their use in ways that conform to WCAG.” Gives no specific argument other than citing an authority. The feature to silence validators for authoring tools could be misused by authors who want to use a validator but don’t want to give alternative text, but if that occurs (which seems unlikely) it is easy to resolve by changing the validator requirements to still clearly announce that the document is invalid while saying it’s not the authoring tool’s fault. This argues in favor of a mitigation that is not part of any Change Proposal.  What does accessibility supported mean?  Posted on Monday, 29 August 2016 by Léonie Watson  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards Tag: ChromeTag: EdgeTag: FirefoxTag: HTMLTag: Safari   With the recent news that Microsoft Edge now has 100% accessibility support for HTML5, this post looks at what “accessibility supported” means, and where it fits into the bigger accessibility picture.  Accessibility comes in many forms and all of them are important. For the purposes of this post however, the term “accessibility” is used to mean the ability of an assistive technology like a speech recognition tool or screen magnifier to access content in the browser. For a feature of HTML (or any other web technology) to be considered accessible, three things have to happen: 1. The browser must support the feature This means that the browser recognises the feature and provides the expected visual rendering and/or behaviour. When the W3C releases a new version of HTML, it makes sure that each element, attribute and API is supported in at least two browsers. This gives developers a reasonable degree of confidence that the features of W3C HTML will work in the wild. 2. The browser must expose the feature to the platform accessibility API This is what is meant by “browser accessibility support”. In addition to supporting a feature as described above, the browser must also expose information about the feature’s role, name, properties and states to the platform accessibility API. The level of HTML5 accessibility support in popular browsers is tracked on html5accessibility.com. These are publicly available tests and results that are updated as new browser versions are released. 3. The assistive technology must obtain and use information about the feature using the platform accessibility API When a feature is accessibility supported by the browser, the assistive technology must use the information exposed to the platform accessibility API. This information is used by assistive technologies in different ways – by a screen reader to tell someone what kind of feature they are using, or by a speech recognition tool to let someone target a particular object for example. In other words the browser is responsible for supporting a feature and exposing it to the platform accessibility API, and the assistive technology is responsible for utilising that information to help people access content in the browser. If either the browser or the assistive technology do not fulfill their responsibilities, then accessibility support is not complete. In practice this means that different combinations of browsers and assistive technologies offer different levels of accessibility support. For example, Edge now has 100% accessibility support for HTML5, and Narrator (the integrated Windows screen reader) takes full advantage of this – meaning that Edge is extremely usable with the Narrator screen reader. In contrast, other screen readers have yet to take advantage of the accessibility information exposed by Edge, and so for now that browser remains largely unusable with those products. According to html5accessibility.com, Chrome, Firefox and Safari all expose less information about HTML5 than Edge. However most screen readers make good use of that information, so all three browsers are usable with screen readers on the relevant platform. The goal is for all browsers to hit the 100% benchmark set by Edge, and for all assistive technologies to make full use of that information. When complete accessibility support becomes a given, people are then free to choose their browser and/or assistive technology based on features and capability instead.  filing bugs  Posted on Sunday, 29 June 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: StandardsCategory: Testing          One of the ways to get things fixed in browsers, or at least understand why things aren’t/won’t be fixed,  is to file a bug. I spend a fair bit of time filing and commenting on bugs. (Updated to include reference to Opera bug report wizard)  Filing bugs: Firefox Example bug: expose heading level in acc layer based on outline depth not heading numeric value Use the Firefox bugzilla, you need to register to file. Read the bug writing guidelines For accessibility bugs Mozilla Accessibility Engineer Marco Zehe  advises   Use product Core, Component Disability Access APIs, and we’ll take it from there. “Firefox: Disability Access” will also work, but usually we assign it to the other product/component straight away anyway. Edge Example bug: HTML5 main element not supported Edge HTML Issue Tracker, you need to sign up for a Microsoft account (if you don’t have one) to file.  Read the Bug reporting guidelines Advice from David Storey: If you can:  Also include a reduction that just shows issue. Include real world site it affects as (at least for IE and Opera in my experience) a bug that affects real world sites have higher priority as it breaks things.   Safari Example bug: HTML indeterminate IDL attribute not mapped to checkbox value=2 Use the Webkit bugzilla, there is an accessibility related category, you need to sign up for a webkit bugzilla account to file.  Read the Bug writing guidelines Chrome You need a Google account to file bugs. Example bug: hr element not exposed with a separator role  Report bugs  Open Accessibility bugs list Bug Reporting Guidelines for the Mac & Linux builds (with links to known issues pages) Instructions for reporting crashes.  Opera Use the Opera bug report wizard (though note that, once filed, you won’t be able to check back on the bug’s status…but if it gets fixed, it’ll appear in the relevant Opera release notes). Writing bugs As an example of things to do when writing a bug report, the IE bug reporting guide is excerpted below:  Before Filing a New Bug Report Ensure you’re running the latest version of the browser, since your issue may already have been resolved in a newer version. Search for existing bugs in the bug database to see if your issue has already been reported. Try to identify specifics steps that would allow us to consistently reproduce the issue you’re seeing, if possible. Please file separate bug reports for each problem encountered. Key Components of a Good Bug Report Title A good bug report has a clear and concise title (usually less than 15 words). Summarizing your problem concisely improves our ability to understand and fix bugs. Good: “[browser version XX] Unable to type in search box of www.example-url.com” Bad:“Search functionality broken” Description A good bug report clearly explains what you were expecting to see, and how it differs from what you actually saw happen. We’ve found that both of these perspectives are valuable and help us fix more bugs. For example, describing your expectation can help us fill in gaps and fix bugs that otherwise might not be reproducible, since bugs sometimes depend on external factors like the language of the underlying operating system. Selecting the correct area A good bug report has the correct area selected. We want to get your bug report to the right developer as quickly as possible, and selecting the correct area in the form helps.  Since some issues might fall under more than one area, try searching in the bug database to find similar bugs in that area. Precise, reproducible steps A good bug report is descriptive and easy to follow. A clear step-by-step guide that lets us reproduce a bug is often the single most important factor in determining whether we can fix a bug or not. When we aren’t able to reproduce the bug, it will often be resolved as “Not Repro”. Clearer and more detailed bug reports greatly improve our ability to understand the underlying issues and respond accordingly.

Thinking About HTML 5 canvas Accessibility  Posted on Monday, 8 June 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   The canvas element is a new element of the ‘in progress’ HTML 5 specification, it provides the ability to create dynamically generated graphics in HTML in conjunction with JavaScript. It has rightly generated a lot of interest due to the possibilities it presents, canvas “can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, or other visual images on the fly”. While its creative features are sophisticated, its ‘feature’ (duplicate all canvas content as HTML inside the canvas element) for providing an accessible content can best be described as a primitive example of ‘bolt on’ accessibility.  canvas Accessibility Issues I consider canvas accessibility (or lack of it) one of the major accessibility issues in the current HTML 5 specification and one that will need to be resolved, so I raised the topic of canvas accessibility on the HTML WG mailing list a few months ago: Are there plans to provide mechanisms to add accessibility hooks for content produced using canvas? As providing a secondary accessible version of an application such as bespin seems like a non starter, and is a prime example of the sort of “bolt on” accessibility that HTML5 was trying to move away from. I have not yet received an answer. Issues and Suggestions Text in canvas There is a native method to display text in canvas (example of its use: Cufón), but no native method to output text as fallback. So the developer using canvas to replace text either needs to implement a method using scripting or manually add the fallback text. It is suggested that to make it practical for developers to provide fallback for disabled users who cannot access the text content directly, a native method that outputs the text as fallback is added to the canvas API. Images in canvas There is a native method for inserting images into canvas (Example of its use: Canvas Slideshow (with HTML5 canvas), but no methods to add a text alternative to the images or method to output such images as fallback. So the developer using images in canvas either needs to implement a method using scripting or manually add the fallback images and text alternatives. It is suggested that to make it practical for developers to provide fallback for disabled users who cannot access the image content directly a native method that allows the addition of text alternatives and an output method that inserts img elements as fallback content, is added to the canvas API. User interface elements in canvas canvas can be used to create interactive interfaces (example of its use: bespin), but there are no methods to assign roles, states and properties to areas of a canvas that represent widgets, controls or links. So the developer who wants to create an accessible interface has to duplicate the content of the canvas interface using HTML elements that provide native roles, states and properties. It is suggested that to make it practical for developers to provide information about UI elements to disabled users who cannot access information visually, native methods be provided that allow for the identification of the roles, states and properties of user interface elements displayed on a canvas, futhermore a method to define discrete focusable areas of the canvas be provided. A crude example of some of the features required in canvas can be illustrated using a HTML image map. The example uses a canvas pie menu demonstration by Ben Galbraith to which a transparent image map has been added. The image map provides keyboard access to segments of the pie menu, it also provides information about their role and state of each and name (text alternative) for each segment. Note: Use of this image map technique, while useful for illustrative purposes is not proposed as a practical solution.

The overflow property specifies whether to clip content, render scrollbars or just display content when it overflows its block level container. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/overflow Making a scrollable region operable for keyboard users is pretty simple. Add tabindex=\"0\". The region will now be included in the focus order and when focused the keyboard user can scroll through the content. Identifying and labelling it for screen reader users is also pretty simple. Add an appropriate role and label to the region using the ARIA role attribute and aria-label attribute. By doing so, screen reader users will get an undertsanding of what this focusable item is and what content it contains. It’s also a very good idea to provide a clear indication of focus on the scrollable region so keyboard users know where they are.  Demonstration scrollable region See the Pen scrollable region demo by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.  Thanks to my friend and colleague Ashley Bischoff, for the code and inspiration.   HTML5 Accessibility – September 2012  Posted on Monday, 10 September 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   HTML5Accessibility.com has been updated to reflect HTML5 accessibility support in the latest browser versions.  FireFox and Safari still lead the pack I have completed another round of testing of HTML5 accessibility support in browsers on Mac and Windows. FireFox on Windows and Safari on Mac OSX still have continue to hold very solid leads on the other browsers tested. Chrome and Internet Explorer on Windows have made improvements in their support in the latest version, but are still under 50%: Internet Explorer suffers and Chrome lags Internet Explorer suffers because it does not implement any accessibility semantics for structural elements such as article and aside. It’s a mystery why the default implict ARIA semantics are not being conveyed via UI autumation in IE10 for elements that have no native UI automation roles? Its accessibility implementation of new HTML5 controls and audio and video elements meanwhile, is very good! Refer to Notes on HTML5 accessibility support in IE 10 for more details. FireFox has caught up with IE in terms of canvas accessibility support. Chrome has started to implement canvas element sub-DOM accessibility support, but its limited to keyboard operability at this time, no semantics of the sub-DOM are exposed. Chrome’s mainstream HTML5 implementation continues to outstrip its accessibility support implementation on both Mac and Windows, it appears that Google are not committing enough resources to implementing accessibility in chrome… Support information for Opera on Windows and Mac and Safari on Windows is not be updated as there appears to be no active effort to implement accessibility in these browsers.  Simple inline error message pattern  Posted on Sunday, 3 January 2016 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   Error messages can be problematic to convey consistently to all users across browsers and assistive technology (AT). Using simple HTML, with a little ARIA polyfil magic if you want to get fancy, you can robustly associate error messages with controls and ensure that users get the message every time.  The issue  You want to display a message to users in the case where they have not filled in a form field correctly.  You want the error to be announced by screen readers when the invalid field is focused. You don’t wan’t any delay between the field getting focus and the error message being announced. You want it to work in as many browser and AT combinations as is possible.    The really simple pattern Add the error message as a child of the label element associated with an input. It is really robust because the error message, when added, becomes part of the accessible name for the control: Non-error state of input type=text: accessible name: “pootish” Error state of input type=text: accessible name: “pootish ERROR – fill it in sucker!” See the Pen ZQLeev by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen. A pretty simple pattern This pattern is almost as robust as the previous, except that it relies on some ARIA magic to polyfil the lack of implementation support for multiple labels. While browsers support the activation behaviour for multiple labels (you can click on any label associated with a control via for/id). Only Firefox currently exposes the correct accessible name. Using a separate label for the error message provides more flexibility in (CSS) decoration and positioning of the message. It results in the same accessible names for the non-error and error states as the really simple pattern. See the Pen rxLERr by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.  Bugs filed As mentioned above, browsers mostly don’t implement the deriving of an accessible name from multiple label elements, so have filed some bugs, so in the future the use of aria-labelledby, in this case, will not be needed.  Edge – incorrect accessible name from multiple label elements Chrome – acc name not produced for labelable elements that have multiple associated labels Firefox – accessible name from multiple label elements missing white space     Nu Markup Validation Service Bookmarklets  Posted on Saturday, 9 June 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: W3C Conformance checker   I noticed that the W3C Nu Markup Validation Service did not have any bookmarklets to provide quick validation of a page currently being viewed. So I made some using the existing W3C validator bookmarklets as the basis:   About the W3C Nu Markup Validator Like the DTD-based W3C markup validation service, the W3C Nu Markup Validator checks the markup validity of Web documents, but instead uses the backend from the Validator.nu engine, which provides non-DTD-based validation support for a number of markup languages. As with the existing W3C DTD-based validator, code contributions are welcome and are publicly acknowledged. So if you’re a developer interested in contributing to the work, you’re encouraged to get involved (a good place to start is by checking out the Validator.nu source code). If you find any bugs in the service, or want to request a new feature, please raise a bug report. Nu Markup Validation Service Bookmarklets To use, add the link(s) as a bookmark in your browser.  Validate Page This is the basic “Validate Page” Bookmarklet. It simply submits the URL for the currently viewed page to the Nu Markup Validation Service for processing. Results appear in the same window. Validate Page (New Window) Like the last Bookmarklet, this also submits the URL of the current page to the Nu Markup Validation Service for processing, but this version will show the results in a new window (tab). Validate Page… Puts up a dialog with a text entry field where you can type in the URL of a page you would like to Validate. The results appear in the current window. Validate Page… (New Window) Same as above but shows results in a new window (tab).

Posted on Monday, 14 June 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Refer to Google Chrome accessibility update  I have written on the issue of Google Chrome accessibility a number of times since its initial release. Progress is being made, but that progress is too slow for some users of Assistive Technology.  As a consequence a petition has been created by Alex Hiironen to highlight the issue that users of Assitive Technology such as screen readers are still unable to enjoy the advances in browser speed and functionality provided by Google Chrome.  The Google Chrome Screen Reader Accessibility Petition  To:  Google, Inc. We, as screen reader users, feel that Google’s new and innovative Web browser, Google Chrome, still has a long way to go in accessibility. We are just asking for the developers of this flourishing browser to consider the needs of a growing audience who is interested in using this browser. We should have the choice to use this browser, and should not be shut out because of conditions we cannot control. Web page text is not readable, and nothing is spoken with various screen access programs such as JAWS, Window-eyes, NVDA, and others. Also, the menus need help in order to be accessible to most windows screen readers. On Linux, the situation is worse. Orca, the GNOME based screen reader, cannot even access this application due to the way the interface is written. In 2010, having inaccessible applications is simply appalling and a Web browser coming from a great company such as google should not be subjected to that horrible label of ‘inaccessible’. Inaccessible programs translates to blind and visually impaired individuals being shut out from using this application. That is not acceptable. Sincerely, The Undersigned Sign the petition If you feel that Google has not made the accessibility of Google Chrome a priority, have your say – Sign the petition. Maybe they will listen.

What is important is that the doctype you use does not trigger browser quirks mode. The simplest doctype to use to ensure that quirks mode is not triggered is the HTML5 doctype: <!DOCTYPE html> For data set and other details refer to: HTML5 Accessibility Chops: data for the masses          Freedom of Choice  Posted on Tuesday, 23 February 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The recent EU ruling requires Microsoft to provide Windows operating system users with a choice of browsers to install rather than having Microsoft Internet Explorer pre-installed. This is a laudable initiative that provides a more level playing field for browser vendors and more choice for consumers. Unfortunately what it does not do is provide informed choice. The advertised freedom of choice for users  The real choice for assistive technology users  When 5 = 2 What the browser choice screen does not do is provide an informed choice for users. Of the Big 5, only Firefox and Internet Explorer  have practical support for assistive technology software such as screen readers and screen magnifiers. This information should be available up front in the “users face” so to speak, this will save those users, who cannot exercise this new found freedom of choice to the full due to browser failings, the hassle of installing the only browser with “Opera Turbo technology” or “the world’s most innovative browser” or the browser “made for everyone“, only to find they cannot use it. Further reading The new “Freedom Of Choice” does not account for accessibility needs! by Marco Zehe. Notes: A user of speech recognition software has pointed out that she finds Opera to be the most usable, Firefox is also usable, but Internet Explorer is not. So for this class of assistive software Opera is a practical choice.  HTML5 Accessibility analysis  Posted on Monday, 17 November 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   HTML5Accessibility.com was updated last week to include the latest results for HTML5 accessibility support in Windows browsers. What do these results mean?  HTML5 Accessibility support: where are we at? The aim of HTML5Accessibility.com is to track the implementation of accessibility support in browsers for a range of  User Interface (UI) features introduced in HTML5. Accessibility support is assessed in terms of the implementation in browsers of mappings for the features to accessibility APIs which Assistive Technology can make use of to convey HTML semantics and UI behavior to users, and the implemented keyboard interaction support for interactive controls. Consistent exposure of the accessibility information and keyboard support across browsers is a cornerstone of an accessible interoperable web. Overview of HTML5 accessibility support in Windows browsers HTML5 Accessibility Support Score   85.5/100   83.5/100  37/100 Firefox have consistently lead the pack in providing accessibility support for new features as they are implemented. This is a great achievement by the Mozilla Accessibility Engineers and really important work, as it allows user with disabilities, who require assistive technology to participate on the web, the opportunity to do so. Chrome support has improved markedly since the last update, and is now on par with Firefox. This is due to the efforts of members of the chromium project working hard to resolve a large number of  bugs. Kudos to these chromium project members! Internet Explorer continues to perform poorly in implementing accessibility support overall. It must be noted that IE support for interactive UI features is on par with Chrome and Firefox, but Internet Explorer continues to be particularly poor in providing accessibility support for non interactive HTML elements. Good news is we can expect improvements from IE soon: @dstorey @stevefaulkner Working on it, more soon! — Frank Olivier (@frankolivier) November 13, 2014   Opera in theory, now Opera has switched to the Blink rendering engine, should have similar support to Chrome, but as Opera provides no accessibility documentation or assistive technology support claims (none that I could find) for any of its browsers, it is considered an unknown entity. What about browsers on other operating systems? Apologies for not providing detailed information on OSX/iOS, Linux and Android etc. I simply don’t have the time to do so at present. The Rough Guide: browsers, operating systems and screen reader support provides an overview of the best OS/browser combinations for accessibility support. In brief: Safari and Chrome both have very good support on OSX/iOS. Firefox has very good support on Linux. Detailed accessibility support information for Windows browsers is available at HTML5Accessibility.com Note: Browser implementation bugs have been filed where applicable and are listed in the ‘notes’ column of the HTML5 accessibility support tables.  Notes on applying multiple labels for a control using the label element  Posted on Thursday, 24 May 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   While it is conforming to have multiple label elements pointing to a single control for labelling purposes, it is not recommended. It has been conforming as per (X)HTML specifications for many years, but it is not robustly supported. Other techniques such as wrapping the label around text and control and aria-labelledby do the job better and are much better supported in modern browsers and assistive technology. multiple labels for a control using the label element Notes, examples and recommendations Further Reading HTML5 Accessibility Chops: form control labeling  HTML5 Accessibility Chops: data for the masses  Posted on Tuesday, 10 April 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   One of the stumbling blocks for working out what the effects on the accessibility of new (and old) HTML5 features is not having any publicly accessible usage data. It is difficult without data to argue for the inclusion of features in HTML5 or working out how features should be accessibility supported. I have made an initial attempt to rectify this by collecting the HTML content of the home pages of the the top 10,000 web sites.I spent most of the Easter long weekend collecting the HTML pages. The original source for the “top 10,000” sites URLs was from this URL list I found on paste bin. I used HTTrack website copier to capture the HTML files. The initial pass was somewhat effected by redirects, so I went through the error log and collected a second list of URLs from the captured pages that had resulted in “page has moved” files. The resulting 8915 HTML pages are a result of the 2 sets of URLs. The HTML content (including URL lists) is provided as a zip file: Top 10000 HTML files zip file – 121 MB (Please only download if you are going to make use of the data) hgroup element usage I have only just started to analyse the data. The first analysis is of the new HTML5 hgroup element and this is as yet only a simple gathering of instances of its use. No attempt has been made as yet, for example, to analyse what percentage of its use conforms to HTML5 author conformance requirements. Of the top 8915 HTML pages, 79 (0.89%) were found to include use of the HTML5 hgroup element. A total of 418 instances of the hgroup were found within the 79 pages. Instances of hgroup element use in top 10000 web sites – home pages Inclusion of hgroup in HTML5 Note: I am a proponent of the removal and/or replacement of hgroup in HTML5, there are currently 5 change proposals being reviewed by the W3C HTML working group chairs on this subject:  Change Proposal: replace hgroup with the subline element  Change Proposal: no-change hgroup Change Proposal: replace hgroup with a simple element Change Proposal: remove hgroup add an outlineMask attribute Change Proposal: Replace <hgroup> with an element that has a simple content model and backwards compatibility.    W3C HTML and WHATWG HTML ‘split’ effect on HTML Accessibility?  Posted on Monday, 23 July 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The recent formalisation of the ‘HTML split’ between the W3C and the WHATWG, is not news to those working in either group. Work continues pretty much as it has, prior to Hixie’s communication to the WHATWG.  HTML Implementation in Browsers The reality is that browser implementation information of HTML will be similar if not the same up until the point where HTML5 is finalised at the W3C. There may be some minor differences due to the W3C spec not keeping up with changes to the WHATWG spec or points where not all browser vendors have agreed on the implementation details of a particluar feature. In the latter case it may be that the WHATWG spec or the W3C spec contains implementation information relevant to some but not all current implementations or a proposed implementation that has not actually been implemented by anybody. It will be the case that as finalisation of HTML5 occurs at the W3C, the browser implementation information in it will become progressively out of date as new features are specced in the WHATWG HTML, implementation bugs arise and are fixed. Concurrently with the finalisation of HTML5 it is envisaged that work on HTML.next will commence at the W3C, taking HTML5 as its basis.  It will likely be the case that HTML.next will mostly track the WHATWG spec on implementation details where browser vendors have indicated they intend to implement the WHATWG spec as written. This is not always the case now and will not be so in the future, for example some of the new additions to canvas contained in the WHATWG spec have not been agreed upon by browser vendors and further work is taking place between Apple and Microsoft and other stakeholders to agree upon the details, this work is occurring in the W3C HTML WG. If it is the case that the Canvas 2d context spec contains agreed upon implementation details that the WHATWG spec does not, then what should occur is the WHATWG spec changes to reflect such consensus. So let us not be fooled into thinking that the current and future specification of HTML is a one way street always leading from the WHATWG to the the W3C. So it may be that at moments in time implementation details in the current W3C HTML (whether that be HTML5 or HTML X) and WHATWG HTML  diverge, but it will not be a permanent divergence unless either spec diverges from reality. It is not the case that WHATWG spec always contains a realistic representation of what is implemented in browsers, it contains defined features that are not yet implemented by any browser even though they have been in the spec (and HTML5) for years. And it omits features implemented in browsers. The command element has been specced for years When Mozilla decided to implement the HTML5 context menu instead decided to use the unspecified (in HTML) <menuItem> element rather than implement the command element. HTML Accessibility Implementation in Browsers While the WHATWG claims its goal is to provide a canonical description of HTML and related technologies,  it only contains a minimal description of how browsers should implement HTML support for assistive technology. The WHATWG have never shown any interest to my knowledge (note: anne van kesteren claims this is FUD, but have not seen anything from the WHATWG leadership to suggest otherwise and Hixie stated the HTML to accessibility API document was unecessary) in specifying the level of detail required for the interoperable implementation of accessible HTML. This work is being carried out at the in the W3C HTML WG as part of the ongoing HTML standardization effort. WHATWG leader Ian Hickson decided to fork HTML rather than include a link to it in the WHATWG HTML: The W3C HTML specification includes a link to an incomplete    document that contradicts this specification because of a    working group decision from February 2011. Author conformance requirements and advice Much of the authoring conformance requirements and advice impacts the accessibility of the authored content. This is where things get less predictable. While requirements and advice in regards to HTML feature implementation in browsers is in essence dictated by what browsers will implement, how such features are to be used is not and consequently the differing HTML development processes between the W3C and the WHATWG have had most effect and will continue to do so. To get author conformance requirements and advice on the how to use HTML into the WHATWG spec, or get it changed, you must convince Ian Hickson (Hixie). If Hixie does not agree with you it doesn’t go in or it doesn’t change. The W3C HTML working group does not work this way. You can present your arguments, research and data to the working group and whether information is added to or changed in W3C HTML is decided by the working group using a consensus process. And yes this can take longer than a simple Yay or Nay from Hixie, but I  think the extra time is worthwhile. Some examples I have long argued that due to the almost complete lack of keyboard access to the the title attribute in browsers, the HTML specification should not include conformance requirements and  authoring advice for the use of the title attribute that will result in inaccessible content. I provided information on this to the HTML WG and Hixie, (then) editor of HTML5:  Advice in spec about annotations promotes inaccessible content Do not consider the title attribute as a  possible conforming source for caption information for an image that  lacks a text alternative Replace poor coding example for figure containing multiple images  Each of these proposals were considered and accepted by the HTML WG and the changes were made to HTML5 to reflect this. While at the WHATWG, Hixie, making no argument either way simply rejected the changes, resulting in further forking of HTML: The W3C HTML specification omits a number of suggestions    regarding using the title attribute, and makes using the title attribute for captions    non-conforming in certain specific cases, because of a number of    working group chair decisions from March 2012:    first,    second,    third. Now I would appreciate ANYONE  explaining how the splintering of authoring conformance requirements and advice being good for anyone? Is it good for users? developers? If not then who? Conclusion What has recently been reported as a split has in effect been happening for some time. If all you care about is how browsers implement or are expected to implement some aspects of HTML then you have little to worry about, both W3C HTML and WHATWG HTML will include pretty much the same information over time. The locus of the HTML accessibility work will continue to be at the W3C and in the HTML WG, the specification of how browsers implement HTML to support accesssibility, will continue in the W3C HTML working group. The development of author conformance requirements and advice based on real world implementations and direct participation from users will continue in the W3C HTML WG. Is this HTML5? The HTML living standard still claims to be HTML5, while the HTML living standard ‘developer edition’ still calls itself “HTML5 A technical specification for Web developers”, so if you are interested in how to use HTML to provide a better, more accessible user experience, then increasingly you will be in a quandary as to which set of rules to follow and which set of rules you are actually following. I think you know which one I would suggest… Further Reading  Mike Smith’s (aka @sideshowbarker) personal comments on the latest WHATWG vs W3C non-news W3C and WHATWG finalize split on HTML5 spec, forking ‘unlikely’ Ian Hickson: Update on the relationship between the  WHATWG HTML living standard and the W3C HTML5 specification  Steve Faulkner: Re:  Update on the relationship between the  WHATWG HTML living standard and the W3C HTML5 specification Ian Hickson: Re:  Update on the relationship between the  WHATWG HTML living standard and the W3C HTML5 specification Steve Faulkner: Re:  Update on the relationship between the  WHATWG HTML living standard and the W3C HTML5 specification       HTML5 Accessibility Chops: Conflicting advice and requirements  Posted on Monday, 13 June 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   HTML is currently defined in multiple documents, each purporting to be THE definition of HTML/HTML5. The documents are developed, published and maintained by 2 separate organisations. The 2 organisations have differing development models, one (W3C) employs a consensus process for resolving conflicts about the normative and informative content of the HTML specification, in the other (WHATWG) all decisions about what is in the specification are made by one person (the editor, Ian Hickson).  The W3C process has over time resulted in consensus based decision’s that Ian Hickson has not agreed with, the end result being that normative and informative content changes have been made to the W3C HTML5 specification that have not been made to the WHATWG HTML living standard and vice versa. It is interesting to note that the majority of these differences relate to accessibility. Below are the intentional accessibility related differences introduced by Ian Hickson, so far: Working Group Decision on ISSUE-131 caret-location-api The WHATWG living standard omits a whole section of implementation requirements for making canvas content more accessible to people with disabilities. Working Group Decision on ISSUE-66 – Image Analysis Heuristics The WHATWG Living standard includes a paragraph of implementation advice    in regards to image analysis heuristics that is considered not helpful to anyone. Working Group Decision on ISSUE-109 aria-section-title The WHATWG living standard omits a paragraph encouraging implementers to make WAI-ARIA features useful to a wider range of people with disabilities and anybody else who they may be useful to. Working Group Decision on ISSUE-122 shalott-example The WHATWG living standard defines normative requirements that forbid authors from providing text alternatives for emotionally rich images. ISSUE-161:  defining mappings from html elements to platform accessibility apis The WHATWG Living standard omits a link to HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide, a work in progress designed to provide the significant amount of accessibility implementation advice not provided in HTML. Working Group Decision on ISSUE-130: table-layout The WHATWG living standard omits advice on how authors can mitigate the negative accessibility effects of layout tables. Working Group Decision on ISSUE-31 / ISSUE-80 validation survey The WHATWG living standard allows authors of HTML emails to omit text alternatives for images. Working group chair decision from May 2011 -Use of ARIA The WHATWG living standard includes a clause that requires conformance    checkers to emit errors for use of ARIA roles in cases where their use improves the accessibility of the content. Working group chair decision from June 2011 WHATWG living standard includes a clause that requires conformance     checkers to emit errors for use of ARIA roles in cases where their use  improves the accessibility of canvas content. Who benefits? Who exactly benefits from the divergence of normative requirements and advice across documents claiming to authoritatively define HTML? If  forking is bad for HTML what are the parties involved doing to to remedy it? I have asked people involved, but as yet no answers have been forthcoming.  Short note on coding alt text  Posted on Tuesday, 15 September 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: HTML   The other day, in relation to a github comment, I was asked by my friend Mike[tm]Smith “Can alt have line breaks in it or does that do weird things to assistive technologies like screen readers?”.  I did some quick testing. What I found was that line breaks in alt attribute text, has a few suboptimal effects, dependent on browser and screen reader used. The noted UX effects of line breaks (limited browser/screen reader combinations tested) in HTML source code of alt are:  Reading of alt text stops at the end of a line. After pressing the continue reading key, reading of the alt text resumes but the object role (in this case “graphic”) is announced at the start of each new line.  Given that a primary use case for alt text is to provide information for screen readers users, it is reasonable that developers should consider not including arbitrary line breaks in alt text, so that the best UX for screen reader users is provided.

What is this thing called HTML? It can be confusing, authors and developers now have a seeming multitude of authoritative sources for the definition of how HTML features work and how HTML features are to be used.  Why use the HTML 5.1 Nightly? It is updated regularly (as the name implies) with the latest new features, bug fixes and editorial changes cherry picked from a range of sources, primarily but not exclusively from the WHATWG spec. Why a range of sources? The development of many new features occurs via the WHATWG as it is the venue of choice for some (but not all, while all browser implementers are members of the W3C). Development of new features also occurs at the W3C (the main element for example) and other organisations. While the HTML WG liaises with the WHATWG and other organisations, the content of the HTML specification is decided by the HTML working group which reviews and works towards technical consensus before adding/modifying features or changing advice  and requirements in HTML, whatever the source. If new features are considered controversial, not fully baked, are better defined as a module, or there are multiple proposals for solving similar use cases, they may be developed as HTML extension specifications. This provides all stake holders an opportunity for review and discussion of the features. HTML is not just for browser implementers From a user’s and developer’s point of view, how to use HTML and how it should be used are important considerations as its use directly impacts those who consume the semantic and structural information and  interaction behaviours that HTML as implemented (or not) provides. The HTML specification – authoring advice and requirements The HTML specification provides authoring advice and requirements; developers use this and authors of books and articles on HTML use it to inform their writing. The HTML 5.1 Nightly version of the specification includes the most up to date authoring advice and requirements, which is actively developed, primarily within the HTML working group  Unlike for the implementation aspects which are primarily dictated by browser vendors, the voices of users, developers and accessibility communities are important sources for deciding what the HTML specification has to say about how HTML should be used.

The details The HTML title attribute is problematic. It is problematic because it is not well supported in some crucial respects, even though it has been with us for over 14 years. With the rise of touch screen interfaces, the usefulness of this attribute has decreased. The accessibility of the title attribute has fallen victim to a unfortunate combination of poor browser support, poor screen reader support and poor authoring practices. Situations in which the the title attribute is not useful due to lack of support:  Displaying information for web content viewed on mobile phone browsers. Typically in desktop browsers title attribute content is displayed as a tooltip. From what I could find, tooltip display is not supported in any mobile browser and alternative visual methods of accessing title attribute content are not supported. Providing information for people who cannot use a mouse. Typically in desktop browsers, title attribute content is displayed as a tooltip. Although the tooltip behaviour has been supported for 10+ years, no browser as yet has implemented a practical method to display title attribute content using the keyboard. Using it on most HTML elements to provide information for users of a variety of assistive technologies. Access to title attribute information is not supported uniformly by screen readers  User groups not well served by use of the title attribute  Mobile phone users. Keyboard only users. Screen magnifier users. Screen reader users. Users with fine motor skill impairments. Users with cognitive impairments  Examples of title attribute use that are USEFUL:  Labelling frame or iframe elements:  <frame title=\"navigation\">   Providing a programmatically associated label for a control in situations where a visible text label would be redundant:  <input type=\"text\" title=\"search\"> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"search\"> labelling controls in data tables.    Examples of title attribute use that are NOT USEFUL or are of LIMITED USE:  For additional information not provided as text in a link or surrounding content:  <a href=\"newsletter.PDF\" title=\"PDF file, size 1 mb.\">newsletter</a> Instead include such information as part of the link text or next to the link.   Providing the same information provided as link text:  <a href=\"newsletter.PDF\" title=\"newsletter\">newsletter</a> Recommend not duplicating content of a link in the title attribute. It does nothing and makes it less likely if people can access title attribute content that they will do so.   For a caption on an image:  <img src=\"castle1858.jpeg\" title=\"Oil-based paint on canvas. Maria Towle, 1858.\" alt=\"The castle now has two towers and two walls.\"> Presumably caption information is important information that should be available to all users by default. If so present this content as text next to the image.   For a label on a control that has no visible text label:  <input type=\"text\" title=\"name\"> Screen readers users will have access to the control label, as the title attribute is mapped to the accessible name property in accessibility APIs (when a text label using the label element is not supplied ). Many other users will not. Recommend including a visible text label whenever possible.   Providing the same information as a visible explicitly associated text label for a control:  <label for=\"n1\">name</label> <input type=\"text\" title=\"name\" id=\"n1\"> Repeating the visible label text does nothing except possibly add cognitive noise for a range of users. Do not do it.   Providing additional instructions for a control:  <label for=\"n1\">name</label> <input type=\"text\" title=\"Please use uppercase.\" id=\"n1\"> If the instructions are important for using the control correctly, then provide them in text near the control, so they can be read by everyone.   Expansion of an abbreviation:  <abbr title=\"world wide web consortium\">W3C</abbr> The title on the abbr element is well supported by screen reader software, but its use is still problematic, as other user groups cannot access the expansion. It is recommended that the expanded form of an abbreviation is provided in plain text when it is first used in a document, and/or a glossary of terms that provides the expanded form is provided. This is not to suggest that that the expansion should not be provided using the title attribute, only that due to its limitations, an expansion in plain text should also be provided.    HTML 5.1 includes general advice on use of the title attribute: Relying on the title attribute is currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by this specification (e.g. requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to apear, which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or tablet). source: HTML 5.1 – the title attribute Use of the title attribute in place of an alt attribute on an img element or for an image caption is prohibited Relying on the title attribute is currently prohibited as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner… source: HTML 5.1 Further Reading  title attribute use and abuse The title attribute – what is it good for?

Often I see images in my twitter stream that contain interesting information and text content. Unsurprisingly this content is not available to people who cannot see the images or have difficulty interpreting graphical content.  Unfortunately the twitter UI does not provide a built in method for providing text alternatives using the standard HTML methods for doing so. You cannot add an alt attribute to images and/or provide a caption using the figure and figcaption elements. What you can do pretty easily is provide the alt text as text in the same tweet as the image (if it fits) or if it is a tweet from someone else or there is not enough space to provide in the same tweet you can reply to the tweet with an alt text.

In many ways Opera is a great browser and Opera 12 includes lots of shiny new stuff, but still no support for assistive technology (AT) users. Opera excels in implementing HTML5 support for some users, but others are left behind. Here are some suggestions on how this could change:  First steps First thing is Opera needs to decide if you want to commit to  making your products accessible to assistive technology (AT) users and if so what products and on  what platforms. Dedicated Resources and Strategy If you decide you want to support AT users then you  need to dedicate resources to it, it is  suggested that it will be a waste of time  unless you commit to having a permanent team who’s responsibility it is to implement, maintain and liaise with other opera engineers etc on accessibility. In other  words you need an accessibility strategy. If you decided to implement accessibility support,  for example on the Windows platform, it is suggested you would need to implement:    Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)  IAccessible2 (IA2) Expose MS COM interfaces ISimpleDOM to provide access to the DOM tree.    Implement the Role, State, Events and Property mappings as per:  WAI-ARIA 1.0 User Agent Implementation Guide HTML to Platform Accessibility APIs Implementation Guide  Probably  the easiest thing to do on this score is look at Mozilla’s  implementation (all the source code is there) and talk to the Mozilla accessibility engineers.

High Contrast Proof CSS Sprites  Posted on Monday, 25 January 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   CSS sprites are a useful method to display graphics while preserving bandwith and improving page rendering times.  One of the problems  with CSS sprites when it comes to their accessibility is that some operating system display themes such as Windows High Contrast mode have the effect of hiding CSS background images. So if an alternative version of the image is to be displayed when a user changes the default theme to suit their requirements, the developer has needed to provide an alternative with  images inserted inline rather than as CSS background images. In many cases the developer does not do this, as it is a lot of extra work and undermines the performance benefits of CSS sprites.  Interfaces can become unusable when high contrast mode is enabled If for example,  I enable Windows high contrast mode while editing this post, the editor interface changes from usable to unusable, as I no longer have any idea what the majority of the buttons on the editor do.   Enabling Windows high contrast mode  Windows XP – Choose a High Contrast Color Combination to Improve Screen Resolution Vista – Turn on High Contrast and change the settings  CSS sprites using the before: pseudo element An alternative to implementing CSS sprites using the traditonal background-image method is available and it resolves the issue of images not being displayed in high contrast mode. This alternative method makes use of the CSS before: pseudo element (note: the after: pseudo element could also be used). Example:   CSS span.test1:before { margin-right: -10px; content: url(icons.png); position:relative; left:-2px; top:-109px; } span.test1 {width:17px; height:18px; display:inline-block; overflow:hidden;} HTML <a href=\"#\"><span class=\"test1\"></span>Home</a> Further examples are available on the CSS sprites using the before: pseudo element example page. Notes:  This is only a proof of concept. I am sure this method can be improved by people who have better CSS skills. The use of the same set icon set for both default and high contrast view is not recommended as the contrast, as in the case of the examples, may be poor when high contrast mode is enabled. A high contrast mode detection script is available, which can be used to swap icon sets as appropriate. I have tested this method in IE 8 (previous versions don’t support before: selector), Firefox 3.6, Opera 10.10, Safari 4 and Chrome 4. They all seem to work fine, but the high contrast mode aspect is currently moot for Opera, Chrome and safari, as they don’t yet support Windows high contrast mode.    AJAX and Screen Readers – Content Access Issues  Posted on Tuesday, 5 February 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIATag: JAWS   The rise in the use of AJAX to dynamically change content without refreshing the page has resulted in accessibility problems for users of Assistive Technology such as Screen Readers. The problem can be divided into two issues  Users not having access to content changes. Users not being aware of the changed content if they can access it.  The first issue, which is detailed in this article, is largely confined to 2 software products, the JAWS and Window Eyes Screen Readers. The second issue potentially affects users of most Assistive Technology including Screen Readers and Screen Magnifiers. Access to updated or new content JAWS and Window Eyes are the 2 most popular screen readers on the Windows operating system. They both provide access to web pages by taking a copy of the DOM of the page displayed in the web browser and storing it in a “virtual buffer”. It is this copy that the user interacts with when browsing (known as “browse mode”), unless they are interacting with some types of form controls in which case they interact directly with the browser (known as “forms mode”). Browse mode When in browse mode the user can navigate to or list many components of page structure including headings, controls, paragraphs and links using keystrokes. One major limitation of browse mode for users of JAWS prior to version 7.1 and all Window Eyes versions is, that unless they do something such as press a button, their view of the content is static. If an independent content update occurs in the browser view of the page it is not automatically updated in the AT users view. Also user dependent changes are not reliably updated, especially when AJAX is used, due to the latency issue. Another limitation is that the user cannot interact with some types of form controls. Forms mode To use a text input, textarea or select element the user must step out of browse mode into forms mode. When in forms mode only content contained in elements that can receive focus or content associated with controls (implicit – content positioned near a control or explicit – label element or title attribute) is practically available to the user. Compared to browse mode, the user’s ability to navigate and access non interactive content is severely restricted. Triggering and Update – JAWS prior to version 7.1 and all Window Eyes versions An update of the screen reader view is never triggered by a change in content in the browser view, only by a user action, either knowingly or unknowingly. For the users view of the content to be updated and synchronised with the browser view, the user must either manually refresh (Window Eyes ctr+shift+A twice, JAWS insert+esc) the screen readers copy of the page or press the enter or spacebar keys, actions which occur when a user activates a link, button or an element with an onclick event attached. enter and spacebar The developers at GWMicro (Window Eyes) and Freedom Scientific (JAWS) both implemented a similar substandard fix to the issue of updating the virtual copy in response to JavaScript based changes in browser content. They figured that if they attached a virtual buffer update command in response to the pressing of the enter or spacebar keys, any content change that may occur, if by chance the element triggered a JavaScript based content change would be included in the new copy, and thus be available to the user. On the surface this may have seem like a reasonable solution, but it has a number of major flaws; the most glaring being that the user must do something in order for the content to be updated, secondly the JavaScript content change process must be completed within 400 – 1000 milliseconds (the average time it takes for the virtual copy update to occur after it is triggered, this varies across screen readers, browsers and browser versions) of the user pressing the enter or spacebar key. If it is not completed within this time frame the updated content will not be included within the updated screen reader view. For most JavaScript routines the time frame is adequate and the change is caught by the copy update, but when AJAX is used for content updates it can regularly take longer than 400 milliseconds to complete. This latency leads to a disconnect between content the user has access to and what is displayed in the browser. Browser and screen reader view disconnect – independent content change An example of the occurence of a disconnect between the browser and screen reader view due to a change in content independent of user action is demonstrated in the independent content change test page. In this example the page loads, after 5 seconds a script is called that removes 1 of the 3 links and 1of the 2 buttons on the page. Users of JAWS < 7.1 and Window Eyes will be presented with the initial content displayed on page load. they will not be informed that a change in content has occurred in the browser and will be able to browse through the original content, although it has changed in the browser. If the JAWS user attempts to follow a link the result will be:  the ‘Google’ link will load the Yahoo page the ‘Yahoo’ link will load the article page the ‘back to article’ link will update the screen reader view so it corresponds with the browser view, but the link will not be followed.  For the Yes and No buttons:  pressing the ‘yes’ button will press the no button pressing the ‘no’ button will update the screen reader view so it corresponds with the browser view, but the action associated with the button is not triggered.  For the Window Eyes user, if they try to activate a link or button that no longer exists in the browser, the screen reader view is updated and the browser/screen reader views are synchronized. Browser and screen reader view disconnect (the latency issue) – user dependent content change An example of the occurance of a disconnect between the browser and screen reader view due to a change in content dependent on user action is demonstrated in the dependent content test page. In this example when the 200 (millisecond) button is pressed a request is sent to the server using AJAX and a response is returned that changes the alt attribute content of the image to “200 milliseconds” and add the text “200 milliseconds” to an empty paragraph. Users of JAWS < 7.1 and Window Eyes will be able to access the changed content in the screen reader view as the time taken for the change to occur (200 milliseconds approximately) is within the acceptable latency period between action and content change. It is caught by the buffer update. When the 1000 (millisecond) button is pressed the same process occurs, but the latency period is 1000 milliseconds (approximately). In this case the buffer update has already occured by the time the content change occurs. As a consequence JAW < 7.1 and Window Eyes users will not have access to the changed content in the screen reader view. So for example, if the user has previously pressed the 200 button, they will still “see” the image alt and text as “200 milliseconds” although the content has changed (to “1000 milliseconds”) in the browser view. JAWS version 7.1 + and content change With the release of JAWS 7.1 there was a marked change in the way content changes are handled. The virtual buffer update is no longer tied to a user action (pressing the enter or spacebar keys), but updates in response to content change events in the browser. So, for example, if text is added or removed , it triggers a buffer update. This is a major improvement in relation to both user dependent and independent JavaScript based content changes. The latency issue (particularly in relation to AJAX) is no longer a problem and the user does not have to do anything for the content change to be updated in the screen reader view. The examples of user dependent and independent content change do not cause a disconnect between browser and screen reader view. There are still some issues which Gez Lemon and I detailed in Improving Ajax applications for JAWS users, but with subsequent releases (current JAWS release is version 9), the support has improved. Conclusion The use of AJAX based content changes is still a formidable accessibility barrier for users of JAWS and Window Eyes, although the technical accessibility issue of access to content changes has been largely resolved in later versions of JAWS, Window Eyes has yet to tackle the problem. It is interesting to note that NVDA, a free screen reader, has better support for content updates than Window Eyes. Furthermore the issue of informing users of content change has not been resolved. There are work arounds such as the use of the JavaScript focus() method to move focus to changed content, but this is not reliable and of use only in limited circumstances. The implementation of support for WAI ARIA live regions by Assistive Technology vendors is required to provide developers with the tools required to resolve the AJAX accessibility issue.  HTML5 Accessibility Chops: the figure and figcaption elements  Posted on Tuesday, 23 August 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The figure and figcaption elements are 2 of the new elements in HTML5. Together they provide the promise of being able to mark-up, with meaning, the structure and relationship between a piece of content and associated content that acts as a descriptive label. Currently as implemented in browsers the semantics of figure and figcaption are practically non existent.  What the HTML5 specification says figure element The figure element represents some flow content, optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a single unit from the main flow of the document. The element can thus be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc, that are referred to from the main content of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow of the document, be moved away from that primary content, e.g. to the side of the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix. figcaption element The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents of the figcaption element’s parent figure element, if any. Code example <figure> <figcaption>Figure 1. JavaScript alert code example</figcaption>  <code> function warning() {alert(\\'Warning!\\')} </code> </figure> Current practical meaning conveyed by elements in the example: <figure> <div> <figcaption> <div>Figure 1. JavaScript alert code example </div> </figcaption>  <code> <span> function warning() {alert(\\'Warning!\\')} </code> </span> </figure> </div> All very interesting but what can I as a developer do now? For the general use cases, until the semantics of figure and figcaption have been implemented in browsers and AT it is suggested that:  Use a descriptive word at the start of the figcaption content to give users an idea of what the content is labelling something, for example “Figure X:” or “Chart Y:” Be consistent in your figcaption labelling within and across pages. Place the figcaption (in the code) before the content to be labelled so it is announced prior to the content it is labelling. For example of use with images refer to HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives:  3.9 Images of Pictures 3.12 When a text alternative is unknown at the time of publication    The background for these recommendations How to convey the semantics? The semantics of  figcaption can be conveyed visually by the placement of the figcaption, above or below the content it labels and through its proximity to such content. From observations of how figures etc are currently marked up, in some cases the figure element semantics will not be indicated visually, though it may be indicated as part of the figcaption text and/or by the addition of a border or background color. Such visual indications do not provide much value for users who cannot make use of them. While proximity provides some indication of a semantic relationship it alone does not suffice. The standard method to convey semantics to assistive technology (AT) is by the use of defined roles and relationships provided by Accessibility API’s. These roles and relationships are typically mapped to HTML elements by the browser and AT accesses the information from the API exposed by the browser. A problem arises with figure and figcaption, because figure does not have a specified role and while figcaption can be mapped to a caption role in some Accessibility API’s others do not provide this role. Element names can be passed through accessibility API properties, but this does not confer a defined accessibility semantic for a given element, thus no common definition of what a particular element is and does is provided, this can and does lead to interoperability issues across browsers and AT. Making it much harder for both users and developers to realize a common user experience across software, devices and platforms. ARIA to the rescue? ARIA can help, but does not offer a complete solution:  It does not include a caption role. It does not include a figure role. aria-labelledby and/or aria-describedby may be used to associate figcaption content with figure content, but their use does not provide the role semantics to differentiate the figure and figcaption semantics from the standard labelling methods of the title attribute and in the case of images the alt attribute.  In order for ARIA to really help it is suggested that the addition of 2 new roles may be required: caption  The object contains descriptive information, usually textual, about another user interface element such as a table, chart, or image. figure The object is a container for a user interface element such as a table, chart, or image and a caption which labels the element. Different scenarios Whether the additonal roles are needed depends on what will provide the best user experience. Do users want to be made aware of both structures? Should the figcaption content be associated with the figure or the content it contains? Should none , one or both of the structures be voiced by AT? Should  the caption always be announced prior to the figure content or after or depend on the caption placement (before/after)? The following scenarios are also available on a test page which has the role information included inline to simulate what would be available to the AT user for each scenario. Scenario 1 The presence of both figure and caption are announced, the figure start and end are voiced. the caption is announced before the content. (Simulates the figure being labelled by the figcaption) Scenario 2 The presence of figure but not caption is announced, the figure start and end are voiced. the caption content is announced before the figure content. (Simulates the figure being labelled by the figcaption) Scenario 3 The presence of caption but not figure is announced, the caption content is announced before the figure content. (Simulates the figure content being labelled by the figcaption) Scenario 5 The presence of caption but not figure is announced, the caption content is announced after the figure content. (Simulates the figure being labelled by the figcaption) Scenario 5 The presence of caption or figure is not announced, the caption content is announced dependent on the placement in the code (before/after) Note: Scenario 5 is what users currently experience. Code example for all scenarios <figure> <code> function warning() {alert(\\'Warning!\\')} </code> <figcaption>JavaScript alert code example</figcaption> </figure> AT output example Scenario 1 Figure start,  Caption. JavaScript alert code example function warning() {alert(\\'Warning!\\')} figure end AT output example Scenario 2 Figure start, JavaScript alert code example function warning() {alert(\\'Warning!\\')} figure end AT output example Scenario 3 Caption, JavaScript alert code example function warning() {alert(\\'Warning!\\')} AT output example Scenario 4 function warning() {alert(\\'Warning!\\')} Caption, JavaScript alert code example AT output example Scenario 5 function warning() {alert(\\'Warning!\\')} JavaScript alert code example What do users want? I have coded a test page with examples, from the scenarios above, simulating what information could be announced and ordered, please give it a try in your favourite AT and provide comments.    HTML5 semantics and accessibility  Posted on Monday, 14 November 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   This  is a comment I made on the article Pursuing Semantic Value The author requested that I post it separately, so I have. Stating the obvious Semantics are not just about accessibility, accessibility is not just about assistive technology. But semantic information (name, role, states and properties) carried by HTML elements and attributes is integral to making content on the web accessible, especially for those who rely upon assistive technology to access and interact with web content. Historically and currently accessibility support for HTML features in browsers lags behind other facets of feature implementation, and unfortunately accessibility support is not taken into account when browsers announce support for a feature. Which is why we get claims about HTML5 structural elements being implemented in browsers. What is actually meant, pretty much, is that visual styling has been implemented. HTML accessibility support Where there are clearly defined semantics already available via acccessibility APIs for new HTML5 features, it is easy for browsers to implement the support and no excuse for AT to not understand and convey the appropriate information to users. The accessibility implementation and semantics of particular HTML5 elements is still being worked out. This is mostly due to the semantics, from an accessibility support perspective, not being well specified or specified at all in the HTML5 specification. The HTML to accessibility API implementation guide is intended to help with this, but it is still in early development hgroup – an element in search of a cowpath For example, the hgroup element is a mess. Why? because it is an element in search of a cowpath. As currently specified it does not provide a useful semantic to assistive technology users, in fact it does the opposite, it removes potential information about subheadings/subtitles/taglines etc, by forcing implementers to collapse the subheading semantics into the parent heading. That is why hgroup is at risk in the W3C HTML5 specification, with 5 detailed proposals to either abolish or replace it. Update 22/02/2015: hgroup is obsolete in HTML5 header – useful or not? Another example is the header element from discussions with browser and AT implementers, it is considered that the header element does not add much value as it does not provide anything that currently available semantics does not. To understand why, it is useful understand the ways in which screen readers can expose HTML element information to users. As a consequence it may well not be implemented in browsers or AT. Update 22/02/2105: A header element that is not a descendant of an article or section element is exposed with a banner role (as per HTML5 implementation requirements) in all modern browsers, except Internet Explorer. HTML5 outline algorithm In regards to the outline algorithm, Jeremy states “The new outline algorithm in HTML5 will make life a lot easier for future assistive technology” which suggests that he is not aware of the implementation of the outline algorithm in JAWS 12/13, unfortunately the current implementation can actually undermine users ability to navigate and understand document structure. Note, also it does not take hgroup into account. Update 22/02/2015: The outline algorithm is still not implemented in browsers and the JAWS implementation was removed in JAWS 14. figure and figcaption – meaning in the pipeline The figure and figcaption elements currently have no semantic meaning. This is partly because the semantics are not defined in accessibility APIs and partly because the available role semantics and labelling relationships have not yet been implemented in browsers. There is active work going on to change that.  As part of working out how the semantics of these new elements could work I wrote a post about the challenges of defining the semantics. At the W3C TPAC meetings last week we discussed the addition of a figure role in ARIA 1.1. There is also moves afoot to add a figure role to the iAccessible2 API, and Firefox are making progress (Firefox bug) on the implementation of the labelling relationship for figcaption/figure and role implementation for figcaption. Browsers have an integral part to play in accessibility support For a long time, the refrain from certain quarters has been, screen readers don’t support feature X its been in HTMLX for ages, F#@King screen reader vendors. They are an easy target. Part of what HTML5Acessibility was set up to do was draw attention to the browser vendors role in providing accessibility support. I suggest that browser implementation is an integral aspect of HTML accessibility support, without it there is not chance of robust, interoperable access to web content for AT users. Take a look at the debacle with longdesc, AT for the most part cannot be relied upon, and should not need to be relied upon to implement accessibility features, without the browsers doing their part. HTML5 a work in progress, get involved! HTML5 is still a work in progress, but it’s at a stage now where significant changes must not be handed down from upon high, the community must have the opportunity to be involved in affecting change. Involvement in the W3C HTML working group provides that opportunity, get involved!  A Brave New alt in {HTML5}  Posted on Monday, 4 August 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   Update 08/08/09 What the King of HTML5 giveth, he taketh away. The use of { } is now HTML5 history. You can wonder at the greatness of his latest proclamations of altness here: Requirements for providing text to act as an alternative for images. update end. After much data crunching Of  ‘billions of web pages’, in his infinite wisdom the King of HTML5 has given us a whole new way of using the alt attribute in HTML5:  <Hixie> i think i might make alt=”” required and say that when you don’t know what the image is, you have to say what kind of image it is (e.g. “uploaded image”, “photo”, “thumbnil”, or whatever) and put that in braces in the alt=”” attribute, as in alt=”{photo}” The results of this can now be found in the W3C HTML5 draft . I myself have not had time as yet to fully digest his latest proclamation. On the face of it, the new way does not comformÂ to WCAG 2.0 guidance, but much of what the previous versions of the draft stated didn’t either. As is the modus operendi of the editor, not co-operative exchange occured with WAI prior to the changes even though the HTML WG charter clearly states: The HTML Working Group will cooperate with the Web Accessibility Initiative to ensure that the deliverables will satisfy accessibility requirements. The editor was clearly cognisant of the fact that collaboration was sought within the HTML WG and the WAI (Web Accessibility Initiative), but chose once again to impose his ideas on the specification without even a sniff of consultation. Consensus and collaboration not confrontation, is what is required to make the next generation of HTML one that works for all. It must be said that the editor is not fully responsible for the farcical nature of the The HTML WG process. W3C process is ridden rough shod because nobody within the W3C is prepared to stand up for the claimed process. Any thoughts on why?  Making sure hidden frames are hidden  Posted on Friday, 16 April 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Testing   An issue that arises fairly frequently in regards to web applications is the use of hidden iframe elements used for retrieving data using JavaScript. While they can be easily hidden from visual display using CSS display:none, they are sometimes picked up by screen readers and other AT that extract the DOM code from browsers and re-present it to users in a form that can be navigated using specific key strokes. For example, the JAWS screen reader provides frame navigation keys: M and Shift+M to cycle forward and back through frame and iframe elements. JAWS also provides a frames dialog (open using insert + F9 that displays a list of frames and iframes on a page identified by their titles. If the title attribute is not present on the frame/iframe then the URL of the source document for the frame is listed.  Furthermore, when a page loads users of some assistive technology hear information about the content of the page including how many frames are present. So understandably informing users of frames that have no usable content and providng access to them is a sub-optimal outcome. How to ensure an iframe is hidden If an iframe contains content that is not intended for users, there are a number of things you can do to ensure it is not available to any users:  Use CSS display:none Set the height and width attributes to “0” set the tabindex attribute to “-1” And just in case a user still manages to encounter the iframe, set the title attribute with text indicating it does not contain anything.  Code example: CSS: iframe.hidden { display:none } HTML: <iframe src=\"javascript.html\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" tabindex=\"-1\" title=\"empty\" class=\"hidden\"> The Future – the hidden attribute HTML5 includes a hidden attribute that can be added to any element: When specified on an element, it indicates that the element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant. User agents should not render elements that have the hidden attribute specified. When supported, the use of this attribute will make the hiding of elements and element content, such as an iframe, simpler. Unfortunately at this time no browser supports the hidden attribute, so taking into account legacy software it will be some years before the use of the hidden attribute can be recommended, until that point the recommendations outlined above will have to suffice.  HTML5 a W3C Recommendation – Accessibility FTW!  Posted on Tuesday, 28 October 2014 by Mike Paciello  Category: Strategy     TPG’s  testimonial  on the publication of the W3C HTML5 Recommendation:  HTML5 is a great leap forward for an accessible web. In HTML5, accessibility is a core design principle. For the first time the semantics of HTML have been mapped, and implementation requirements defined in terms of the way HTML semantics are conveyed to people using assistive technologies. The addition of new interactive controls, native video and captioning and new structural elements in HTML5, make it easier than ever for developers to create HTML interfaces that are usable by everyone. The inclusion of WAI-ARIA in HTML5 also provides developers with the tools and information to create accessible custom content and controls that extend the core features of HTML. The Paciello Group (TPG) is both proud and honored to have contributed to the development of HTML5, but recognizes that it is not an end in itself. HTML5 represents a very positive step in the evolution of the language of the web and TPG welcomes the opportunity to continue contributing to its positive development. Mike Paciello– Founder, The Paciello Group (TPG)  Further reading Since 2007, TPG staff have actively contributed to the development of HTML5 at the W3C.

Attempting to tease out the rhyme and reason of its behavior.  To understand why it does what it does. To understand how it does what it does. To understand how it ticks. To understand.   Introducing the JAWS open issue tracker From experience, we at TPG believe strongly that having access to an open issue tracker for software, to raise an issue or request a feature implementation, is a very important aspect of improving user experience through interoperable implementation of web standards. We at TPG are active contributors to browser and, where available, assistive technology issue trackers, filing issues on HTML, ARIA, CSS and SVG feature implementations and bugs. We also work within the web standards community to help define the standards that software implementers use to ensure interoperability and accessibility. Recently we have been working with our colleagues at Freedom Scientific to bring the same sense of open dialogue we enjoy with other web software implementers to JAWS. This has taken the form of an open issue tracker for the JAWS screen reader. The VFO Standards Support repo is a public space where anybody can file an issue on JAWS support for HTML, CSS, ARIA and SVG. We at TPG will then work to triage issues raised to identify whether they represent an issue with JAWS or their source lies in browser, markup or user understanding. Where we find JAWS issues we will file bugs with the JAWS developers and update the public issues with information on milestones for a fix or reasons for not fixing etc. We will, of course, encourage our colleagues at Freedom Scientific to contribute directly to the open issue tracker. Reporting issues If you find an issue with JAWS support for ARIA, CSS, HTML, or SVG, please file an issue with the following information:  Concise title that summarizes the issue Brief description of the issue JAWS version Name and version of the OS and browser Expected result Actual result Test case that demonstrates the issue – provide a linked test case codepen/JSbin etc.  Note: please do not file general support issues here. Please contact Freedom Scientific Technical Support to report general issues with JAWS. Support Documentation As part of the issue tracker repository we are developing documentation and test cases which informs anybody that may find it of interest of the feature support in JAWS for web technologies. So far we have made a start on:  HTML ARIA  Note: This is very much a work in progress, which will be continually updated. Forks and pull requests more than welcome.  In browser spellchecking  Posted on Thursday, 9 February 2017 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   “Necessity is the mother of invention” We have changed our Quality Assurance (QA) methods recently at TPG and now require a screen reader friendly method to find spelling errors in HTML content displayed in the browser. I first looked at extensions for Firefox and Chrome and found them wanting. Then looked at bookmarklets as these are lightweight, don’t require installs and don’t require enabling permissions to snoop on your data ;-).  Enabling spellchecking on a web page is pretty simple, it requires adding 2 attributes (contenteditable and spellcheck) to the body element: <body contenteditable=\"true\" spellcheck=\"true\"> What effect do these attributes have? contenteditable makes any content in the subtree of an element editable, this allows the spellcheck attribute to do its magic. So by placing contenteditable on the body element, all of the content displayed in a page becomes editable and thus spell checkable. spellcheck enables the browser’s built in spellchecker (if it has one) to check and indicate any spelling errors found in editable content. In Firefox, for example, any spelling errors are identified visually with a squiggly underline:  Just as importantly, a misspelled word is identified (in Firefox) via  iAaccessible2 accessibility API Text attributes with an invalid property, with a value of spelling :  This means that screen reader software such as JAWS and NVDA announces the presence of misspelt words. The spell check bookmarklet Anybody who knows how can open up a browser’s developer tools and add the contenteditable/spellcheck attributes to the body element of the currently displayed page, but that is a hassle. It’s much easier to add these attributes via a bookmarklet. JavaScript Bookmarklet code: javascript:document.body.contentEditable=\\'true\\';document.body.spellcheck=\\'true\\';void%200 Adding the code to the href attribute of an a element, produces the spell check bookmarklet: spell check Simply drag the bookmarklet onto your bookmarks bar, or select ‘Bookmark this link’ from the link context menu, and press the bookmark when on a page you wish to spell check. That’s it, done! Further reading How do I use the Firefox spell checker?

Accessibility APIs If the term accessibility APIs has you scratching your head, read Why accessibility APIs matter by the one and only Marco Zehe. The accessibility tree Tree of accessible objects that represents the structure of the user interface (UI). Each node in the accessibility tree represents an element in the UI as exposed through the accessibility API; for example, a push button, a check box, or container. Example baseline test using the native HTML button element Most of the considerations listed below do not need to be checked for a native HTML button as you get them for free (thanks to the browser implementers).

Standard states and properties for <button> are already provided by browser (focusable, focused, unavailable [if disabled attribute used). You can check them using aViewer or other accessibility object inspection tool.    color contrast Check that contrast between the label/description/icon and its background is perceivable/usable for low vision users. Use a color contrast checker.    high contrast mode Most OS’s have a high contrast mode.

A personal opinion UI accessibility is not an accessory, a ‘nice to have’. If a UI is not accessible it’s incomplete, substandard, half baked – a neckbeard UI — Steve Faulkner (@stevefaulkner) August 14, 2014  Further reading  What ARIA does not do Notes on notes (of smart people) about web components Using the tabindex attribute Building an Accessible Disclosure Button – using Web Components disclosure-button custom control HTML5 accessibility implementation support in browsers     aViewer 2012 alpha  Posted on Thursday, 10 May 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Refer to: aViewer 2013  HTML5 Canvas Accessibility in Internet Explorer 9  Posted on Tuesday, 21 September 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The recently released Internet Explorer 9 beta implements the HTML5 specification’s canvas element fallback concept. This means that the content inside a canvas elements start and end tags is exposed to assistive technology users even when the browser supports canvas. It also means that any interactive elements, inside a canvas elements start and end tags such as links or form controls will be included in a documents default tab order even when the browser supports canvas.  A Portuguese translation of this article by Mauricio (Maujor) Samy Silva. Canvas in IE9 has a navigable sub DOM The HTML5 specification states: When a canvas element represents embedded content, the user can still focus descendants of the canvas element (in the fallback content). This allows authors to make an interactive canvas keyboard-focusable: authors should have a one-to-one mapping of interactive regions to focusable elements in the fallback content. Which translates as meaning the content inside a canvas element: <canvas> <p>content</p></canvas> If interactive, should be included in the tab order and operable with the keyboard. All content should be accessible to assistive technology such as screen readers. So in the canvas example, the text alternative should be announced by screen readers and the link should be navigable and operable using the keyboard. Until now, this behaviour had not been implemented in any browser that supports canvas, but with the release of Internet Explorer 9, there is now a browser that does implement it as per the HTML5 specification. So if you are using IE9 with the keyboard to navigate interactive elements, you can tab to the link in the canvas example. If you are using a screen reader, you can also access the text alternative (in this case) content inside the canvas element. Canvas example with a text alternative inside the canvas element. Canvas example HTML code: Note: added an ARIA role=”img” to identify the canvas object. <canvas id=\"example\" width=\"260\" height=\"200\" role=\"img\">   <p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle\">rectangle</a> with a black border. In the background is a pink circle. Partially overlaying the circle is a green square and a purple triangle, both of which are semi-opaque, so the full circle can be seen underneath.</p>   </canvas> Some Potential Issues  Where content is currently included in canvas, it is almost exclusively of the “get a better browser that supports canvas” variety, so screen reader users will likely encounter this when using IE9. Authors will most likely continue to provide useless information (for screen reader users) as the concept of “fallback content” in the HTML5 specification is not a suitable concept of what canvas content is for keyboard and AT users in browsers that support the canvas element. keyboard focus is lost if interactive elements are included inside the canvas, because while elements inside the canvas element are focusable by default, there is no corresponding default indication of focus to identify where current focus is.   NVDA – a free and open source screen reader for Windows  Posted on Wednesday, 16 January 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: FirefoxTag: Internet ExplorerTag: NVDATag: Windows   People often ask on the various accessibility related forums and mailing lists, a question like: If I wanted a Screen reader program which one should I buy? For many developers is it worth buying a screen reader product like JAWS or Window Eyes? Its usefulness for providing meaningful results, in regards to the accessibility of a web site or web based application to a screen reader user, is limited by the relative inability of the non-disabled user to appreciate and understand the user experience of a person who has to use a screen reader to interact with the web and desktop applications. The only practical way to gain any sense of this is by sitting down with actual users of assistive technology and observing how they interact with the web and desktop. Another barrier for the disabled and non-disabled users alike is the complexity of screen reading applications, try looking through the JAWS keystroke documentation to get an idea; there are 150+ keystroke combinations just for using the web! Having said this, it is useful and desirable for developers to have some first hand experience with a screen reader or other assistive technology. For example, it can be useful to test the new web standards based AJAX widget you just developed, to find out if the information that is available visually is technically available to the non visual user, though this information is probably better obtained using tools such as aDesigner or Accprobe, which provide a view of the MSAA or IAccessible2 hierarchy of currently running applications or rendered documents. Furthermore, acessibility user testing will always be required to ensure the actual accessibility of your widget for a screen reader user. If you do want to experiment with a screen reader, rather than paying out large amounts of cash, why not try one of the free screen readers that are available such as NVDA (Non Visual Desktop Access), a free and open source screen reader for Windows. Like JAWS and Window Eyes, NVDA uses a virtual buffer to provide access to web pages. When used in conjunction with Internet Explorer it exhibits similar problems (as JAWS prior to version 7.1 and all Window Eyes versions in both IE and Firefox) with JavaScript (including AJAX) based content changes. Used with Firefox it updates the virtual buffer in response to content changes (as does JAWS 7.1+ in both IE and Firefox). So it is usefulÂ to replicateÂ the sort ofÂ contentÂ update issues thatÂ occur in JAWS and Window Eyes, when browser content is updated without a page reload. General Features of NVDA:  Browsing the web (with Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox) Reading and writing documents with programs such as Wordpad or Microsoft Word Sending and receiving email with Outlook Express Using command-line programs in Dos windows Producing basic spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel General computer management through My Computer / Windows Explorer, Control Panel applets, and other generic Windows tasks.

We want to share the updated aViewer with you and in the process elicit your feedback on the new features and any bugs you may find.  Features  Exposes MSAA, iAccessible2, ARIA, HTML DOM and UI Automation properties. Note: UIA properties will only be displayed for browsers that support it i.e. Internet Explorer, same goes for IA2 which is supported in FireFox and Chrome, but not IE. Displays a navigable accessibility tree. The tree scope can be customized via the ‘view’ menu.  Accessibility properties, accessibility tree and HTML code panes. Customize which MSAA, IAccessible2 and UIA properties to display via the settings dialog:  Show balloon tip with MSAA, IA2 and HTML code information on element hover, focus or as you navigate the accessibility tree.  Information to display in the balloon tip can be customized by using the View (alt+v) menu – ‘balloon tips’ sub menu.  Submit button with associated balloon tip displaying MSAA information for the element.   Customize what to display via the view menu (alt+v):    IAccessible2 relations are  listed in the object information tree view    What this means is that if an element has an associated label which is associated using the IA2 labelledby relation type (for example, this relation is used extensively in FireFox) or it has any of the ARIA relationship attributes (also supported in FireFox) you can select the relation  target in the tree view and the element it is referenced by will be highlighted in the page:     Screenshot showing a focused element , the listing in aViewer of its labelledby relation and its associated targets. One of the targets listed is selected and the referenced element is highlighted on the page   The aViewer Toolbar  Watch Focus (F4) – Information will be displayed for the element that has focus Watch Cursor (F5) – Information will be displayed for the element that is under the cursor Show Highlight Rectangle (F6) – places a visible highlight rectangle around the element that is currently being inspected Show tooltip (F3) – displays tooltip in context with MSSA information (note: accessible name for this button is not currently user friendly) Copy Text to Clipboard (F7) – copies all the information currently displayed to the clipboard Focus Rectangle Only (F8) – disables all features except the keyboard focus rectangle Navigate to Parent Object (F9) Navigate to First Child Object (F10) Navigate to Previous Sibling Object (F11) Navigate to Next Sibling Object (F12) Show Online Help (F1) – opens the Aviewer help in a browser window. Desktop Mode – Disables HTML and ARIA inspection features. Settings –  Modify displayed properties via the check boxes Change font and size In order to inspect IAccessible2 information the DLL needs to be registered on initial use.  Register Unregister        Keyboard Shortcuts For moving focus to:  Treeview: Shift+F1 Listview: Shift+F2 Editbox: Shift+F3  Note: the settings and desktop mode don’t currently have keyboard shortcuts, but can be activated using the keyboard by tabbing to the toolbar then using the arrow keys, then spacebar/enter to enable/disable. Note: this version does play better with screen readers and  we are working on improvements. Note: the HTML view works in FireFox and IE, but not Chrome as Chrome not expose the required information. Issues:  There are still issues for screen reader users, that we are working on, but we hope this is a step in the right direction. When navigating the page content (not via the accessibility tree), the balloon tips can only be displayed using keyboard navigation on focusable elements (any element will display a balloon tips using the mouse). I have created a simple bookmarklet that adds tabindex=0 to every element on a page: Add tabindex=0 This can be used by keyboard only users to allow in page navigation of all elements. We will look also at adding this as a feature of aViewer. Appears to work better on windows Vista than windows 7, especially with NVDA.  You can try aViewer out on a test page which has includes all the HTML/HTML5 form controls. Note: the level of implementation support for new HTML5 controls varies by browser. Note: the HTML code view works in FireFox and IE, but not Chrome as Chrome does not expose the required information. In Firefox the code view displays the inner HTML for the currently focused element. In IE it displays the outer HTML for the currently focused element.

Thoughts on “Notes from the future of HTML session at TPAC”  Posted on Thursday, 29 October 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development   Stinkin’ thinkin’ on HTML @w3c (AKA what i would be saying at #TPAC2015 if I was there) HTML is being discussed, again, at W3C. HTML5 was published as a recommendation at W3C a year ago. One of the tasks it was talked about at the time was maintaining HTML5 the Rec, so at least it didn’t include silly errors like typo’s. AFAIK, no typo’s have been fixed. Nobody at W3C could agree on an errata process… The only editor at the party Furthermore, there was discussion about modularisation, I was tasked with creating a module, testing the waters. I did that, I also worked with the reconstituted WHATWG editorship to make the WHATWG HTML and W3C HTML 5.1 specs align on this. Both specs now defer to the relevant specs in regards to accessibility implementations of HTML feature semantics and ARIA in HTML. I have also fixed some bugs in the bits of HTML 5.1 I feel confident about editing, but have been constrained by Spork, the editing process, being a PITA to make edits with. Drifting For most of the past year, both the WHATWG HTML and the W3C HTML 5.1 spec have been unattended, this changed dramatically on the WHATWG side, recently, when Hixie relaxed his total control over the editorship to a small group of other people. Meanwhile W3C HTML lopes along behind, picking up automagically a subset of commits from WHATWG. The major differences between the two specs are documented. Why maintain? What possible reasons could there be to continue develop a separate version of HTML at the W3C? The only one offered is IPR. There may well be a lot of other reasons, but none have been clearly stated for the record. My reasons The reason why I got into editing HTML at the W3C was because I disagreed with the process of WHATWG’s ‘benevolent dictator’ model of stewardship, which, I believe, lead to aspects of the definition of HTML being suboptimal. For example, the definitions of blockquote, cite, lack of an element for indicating the main content of a document, the advice on how to provide text alternatives, use of ARIA in HTML, leading developers up the garden path on the document outline, use of the title and placeholder attributes etc. The value of W3C HTML to me is that it is a specification of HTML that is not completely the vision of a small group of browser implementers. Fuzzy stuff Much of what I was, and am still interested is not the stuff that browser implementers have any interest in, but does effect how web developers use HTML. Thus most of the differences bewtween W3C and WHATWG are not about how browsers implement stuff, but how web developers do stuff. I think for example making developers aware that the outline algorithm doesn’t work yet and may never work as defined is an important piece of information for web developers and has important consequences for end users. So much so I have Suggest[ed] adding a warning about outline algorithm to WHATWG HTML. I also think that having clear information about using ARIA in HTML, in HTML, is useful for web developers. The cream I believe, there has and continues to be a view that because one group of people do most of the important stuff of defining how HTML is implemented, a natural consequence is, they have the authority, the right, and skill set to also define how it is used, to define the meaning of HTML and to impose the same model of development on the definition of the semantics of HTML as is considered to work for the implementation aspects of HTML. This view is not born out, by my experience. main argument I was encouraged to file an issue about the differences between the definition of the main element between WHATWG and W3C HTML to see if we would could reach some closer aligment between the definitions. I sorely regret this now as it resulted in the re-opening of wounds. But I also think it illustrates the main reason why we still need a HTML spec at the W3C, not for the implementation aspects (even Microsoft looks at WHATWG HTML for implementations now), but for the definition of HTML as a markup language; how it is to be used, what it means, how its use affects users. A suggestion for the future of HTML at W3C The HTML specification could be divided up into 3 class of content:  UA implementation details and requirements Conformance checker implementation details and requirements Feature definitions, details, authoring conformance requirements, examples, advice  The HTML W3C specification content is derived from the WHATWG HTML spec for 90% (ballpark) of 1 & 2 the divergences are minor (but still in some cases considered important) and in many cases due to error not conscious decisions of the W3C. For 3, the divergences are both more pronounced and mostly willful, due to disagreements between the WHATWG editors and contributors and the W3C WG members and editors about the semantics, conformance requirements and advice for use of HTML. I make some assumptions: For IP purposes the importantant content in the HTML spec is the UA implementation definition of features and this is a primary driver for continued publication of a copy of whatwg HTML at the W3C. For authoring purposes, the important content is 3 and it is a primary driver for continued publication of an actively edited HTML at the W3C, but is not a reason to continue copying these aspects of the content from the WHATWG (and then modifying it where there are differences.) The proposal: Continue to publish a ‘living’ delta of the WHATWG spec consisting of the UA requirements which will satisfy the IP requirements. This delta will be an exact and up to date copy of the WHATWG spec. For the rest of the content, fork the current HTML 5.1 spec (which includes both W3C and WHATWG content) and then cease to update from the WHATWG spec. HTML at W3C will then reference the the delta for UA requirements, but the rest of the content will be solely edited at the W3C going forward. If there are UA/comformance checker requirements/features not present in the WHATWG delta or there are divergent requirements, the W3C HTML specification can reference other relevant specs.  Note: Originally published on Medium, but feel safer having it published here as well.  Simple standalone toggletip widget pattern  Posted on Friday, 15 January 2016 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: UX   Tooltips have always bugged me, apart from regularly mispelling as “TOOTlips” it is a bugger trying to create one that works across browsers with Assistive Technology (AT), in particular screen readers (I have also had a long history in battling the demons of native (title attribute) display in browsers). Then there is the issue of how the trigger control is to be represented and how the keyboard only user UX is best provided and the more general UX of using mouse hover as a trigger for content display.  I think I have come up with the rudiments of a robust pattern that resolves all (at least most of) the problems I have encountered with tooltips: Important: It’s not meant to be a replacement for single word or term tooltips, it’s for those times when a paragraph(s) of text, structured text and interactive content is displayed. Say hello to the toggletip™ (no more tootlip) See the Pen eJgXKd by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.  What it does  Uses a real button as a control. Places the displayed content next in DOM order after the button. Uses some ARIA magic to augment the semantics and behaviour. Displays or dismisses content on click, press or tap (also dismisses on esc key press). Conveys state (collapsed or expanded) to AT users. When initially displayed content is announced by (most) screen readers that support aria-live. Screen readers users can also virtual cursor through and interact with the displayed content. keyboard only users can interact with controls in the displayed content.  What it does not do Display content on mouse cursor hover. Notes:  Yes, the CSS and JavaScript could be improved (I am crap at both), so please do. Thanks to Sir Ian of Pouncey for his help making the JavaScript work. debug view of the toggletip Feedback welcome!   HTML5 canvas sub DOM  Posted on Friday, 6 February 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   All modern browser implement the HTML5 specification’s canvas element fallback concept. This means that the content inside a canvas elements start and end tags is exposed to assistive technology users even when the browser supports canvas. It also means that any interactive elements, inside a canvas elements start and end tags such as links or form controls will be included in a documents default tab order even when the browser supports canvas.  Canvas has a navigable sub DOM The HTML5 specification states: When a canvas element represents embedded content, the user can still focus descendants of the canvas element (in the fallback content). When an element is focused, it is the target of keyboard interaction events (even though the element itself is not visible). This allows authors to make an interactive canvas keyboard-accessible: authors should have a one-to-one mapping of interactive regions to focusable elements in the fallback content. (Focus has no effect on mouse interaction events.) Which translates as meaning the content inside a canvas element: If interactive, should be included in the tab order and operable with the keyboard. All content is accessible to assistive technology such as screen readers. So in the canvas example, the text alternative should be announced by screen readers and the links are navigable and operable using the keyboard. If you are using any modern browser with the keyboard to navigate interactive elements, you can tab to the links in the canvas example. If you are using a screen reader, you can also access the text alternative (in this case) content inside the canvas element. Canvas example with a text alternative and interactive elements (links) inside the canvas element. Canvas example HTML code: <canvas id=\"example\" width=\"260\" height=\"200\"> <h2>Shapes</h2> <p>A rectangle with a black border. In the background is a pink circle. Partially overlaying the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle\" onfocus=\"drawCircle();\" onblur=\"drawPicture();\">circle</a>. Partially overlaying the circle is a green <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square\" onfocus=\"drawSquare();\" onblur=\"drawPicture();\">square</a> and a purple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle\" onfocus=\"drawTriangle();\" onblur=\"drawPicture();\">triangle</a>, both of which are semi-opaque, so the full circle can be seen underneath.</p> </canvas> NVDA announces Canvas sub DOM content (from example page): “Shapes heading  level 2 A rectangle with a black border. In the background is a pink circle. Partially overlaying the visited  link circle. Partially overlaying the circle is a green visited  link square and a purple visited  link triangle, both of which are semi-opaque, so the full circle can be seen underneath.” Other examples:  Hello (hello hello) World! – the dirty <canvas> accessibility hack. Funky canvas coat for a wallflower checkbox  Video demo’s:  NVDA reading canvas sub-DOM content in Firefox ZoomText reading canvas sub-DOM content in Firefox  Some Potential Issues  Where content is currently included in canvas, it is almost exclusively of the “get a better browser that supports canvas” variety, so screen reader users will encounter this when using any modern browser. Authors will most likely continue to provide useless information (for screen reader users) as the general definition of “fallback content” in the HTML5 specification is at odds with how canvas content is presented to keyboard and AT users in browsers that support the canvas element and at odds with how the term is used in reference to other embedded content elements where the fallback content is ONLY available to users if the prmary content is not supported. Keyboard focus is lost if interactive elements are included inside the canvas, because while elements inside the canvas element are focusable by default, there is no corresponding default indication of focus to identify where current focus is. This means that developers must provide pseudo focus rings that are displayed when an interactive element in the canvas sub DOM receives focus, an example of this is provided triggered by inline (for demo purposes only) onfocus/onblur event handlers. There is a proposal for dedicated canvas API methods for the display of focus rings, but these have not yet been agreed upon or implemented.  Developers Be(a)ware In Firefox and IE and Chrome and Opera and Safari HTML content inside the canvas element is available at all times to assistive technology users and keyboard users can operate links and controls and they are included in the default tab order. So please provide alternatives to on screen canvas content and interactivity in the canvas sub DOM. DO NOT include a dumb message telling the user that they need to get a browser that supports canvas! HTML5 definition of ‘fallback content‘ Some embedded content elements can have fallback content: content that is to be used when the external resource cannot be used (e.g. because it is of an unsupported format). The element definitions state what the fallback is, if any. This general definition of fallback content is problematic, because in the case of canvas and how its use pertains to assistive technology and keyboard users. In modern browsers the <canvas> element is supported, so the content in the sub DOM is not fallback. The example I provided could  have had hit testing on the shapes drawn on the canvas so that a click event could be passed to the links in the sub DOM. The use of the term ‘fallback’ for the contents of the sub DOM helps to mislead developers about sub DOM use. An example of erroneous information is provided in the video: HTML5 Canvas Fallback Content Tutorial  Rough Guide: browsers, operating systems and screen reader support  Posted on Monday, 6 February 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Refer to: Rough Guide: browsers, operating systems and screen reader support – Updated  Google Chrome Frame – accessibility black hole  Posted on Wednesday, 23 September 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: Chrome   See update 07/2012: Google Chrome accessibility update Google have released Chrome Frame a plugin-in for Internet Explorer “that seamlessly brings Google Chrome’s open web technologies and speedy JavaScript engine to Internet Explorer.” What it also does is seamlessly bring Google Chrome’s lack of support for assistive technologies to Internet Explorer.  If a page is viewed through Google Chrome Frame in Internet Explorer no content is available to the user of assistive technology (AT). This can be illustrated using the Microsofts accexplorer tool: An example page viewed without Google chrome frame: When not using Google Chrome Frame, all of the content is available in Internet Explorer to assistive technology via the MSAA Accessibility API.  The same example page viewed using the Google Chrome Frame plug-in: No content is available to assistive technologies via the MSAA accessibility API. Effectively the whole page becomes invisible to users of AT.  Why would a user of AT install Google Chrome Frame? Like other people it is presumed users of AT want the opportunity to take advantage of the latest technologies and powerful new features Google Chrome provides, and may want to install the plug-in if they are prompted to do so to access site content. What does the lack of support for AT in Google Chrome Frame mean? Users of AT are locked out of taking adavantage of “Google Chrome’s open web technologies and speedy JavaScript engine” until Google makes its Google Chrome Browser and Google Chrome Frame plug-in fully support assistive technology.

The HTML5 Document Outline  Posted on Monday, 28 October 2013 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   Is a concept that lives in the HTML specification, but is essentially a fiction in the real world. It is a fiction because user agents have not implemented it and there is no indication that any will.   The HTML5 Document Outline is a dangerous fiction It is dangerous because it can lead unsuspecting developers to think that using the nesting of heading elements in sectioning elements actually has some effect for users who consume heading semantics. Overwhelmingly the opposite is true. For example If you code a heading as a h1 element and nest it 5 deep in sectioning elements, the document outline leads us to believe that the heading will be a h6, back in the real world the heading is a h1. <!-- theoretical HTML5 document outline --> <!DOCTYPE html> ... <body> <h1>heading text</h1>  <section><h1><h2>heading text...   <section><h1><h3>heading text...    <section><h1><h4>heading text...     <section><h1><h5>heading text...       <section><h1><h6>heading text...       </section>      </section>    </section>   </section> </section> </body> <!-- What users get -->  <body> <h1>heading text</h1>  <section><h1>heading text   <section><h1>heading text    <section><h1>heading text     <section><h1>heading text       <section><h1>heading text...  <!-- DO THIS IF YOU WANT USERS TO GET A MEANINGFUL OUTLINE --> <body> <h1>heading text</h1>  <section><h2>heading text...   <section><h3>heading text...    <section><h4>heading text...     <section><h5>heading text...       <section><h6>heading text... Practical advice If you as a developer want to provide a meaningful document structure, use the h1–h6 elements to express document structure. DO NOT rely upon the HTML5 document outline. By all means use the HTML5 section elements, but do not rely upon them to convey a meaningful structure. If at some point in the future the HTML5 document outline ceases to be a fiction, you will be covered as the use of h1-h6 is backwards compatible. The advice in the HTML specification is clear on this: Sections may contain headings of any rank, and authors are strongly encouraged to use headings of the appropriate rank for the section’s nesting level. There is now (16/04/14) a warning in section 4.3.10.1 Creating an outline of the HTML spec There are currently no known implementations of the outline algorithm in graphical browsers or assistive technology user agents, although the algorithm is implemented in other software such as conformance checkers. Therefore the outline algorithm cannot be relied upon to convey document structure to users. Authors are advised to use heading rank (h1–h6) to convey document structure. If you don’t think it is clear enough, please file a bug.

Posted on Monday, 23 April 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Anybody with any real  world accessibility experience knows that using CSS :focus {outline:none} as recommended in the WHATWG HTML living standard is not a solution to any problem, it only replaces one accessibility issue with another. This why I worked hard to get the advice still present in the ‘living standard’ removed from the W3C HTML5 specification.  killing CSS outlines for mouse users only Note: I am not advocating removal of CSS outlines, but if you must, do it in a way that does not screw keyboard users The problem  Some developers/designers/clients do not like the default focus rectangle that is displayed when a user clicks on an interactive element such as a link. Methods to remove it such as onfocus=\"blur()\" result in keyboard users being unable to interact with the link or control. While use of CSS outline:none results in the link or control being focusable but with no visible indication of focus for keyboard users. Neither method provides an accessible user interface. An accessible solution?  Starting with the page having no CSS outline:none rules applied. Apply CSS outline:none rules using JavaScript ONLY IF mouse user depressesing the mouse button is detected. Remove the rules again IF keyboard interaction is detected. Example code: <!DOCTYPE HTML> <html> <head> <style id=\"poot\"></style> </head> <body onmousedown=\"document.getElementById(\\'poot\\').innerHTML=\\'a{outline:none}\\';\" onkeydown=\"document.getElementById(\\'poot\\').innerHTML=\\'\\'\"> <a href=\"#\">test link</a> </body> </html> Notes:   A test page is available Example only suppresses outline on links for mouse users. Tested with Firefox, IE, Chrome, Opera and Safari on Windows. Use of inline event handlers is for demonstration purposes only. If you create a more sophisticated script based on this idea please share  Aireh Glazer has created a Cross-Lib accessible outline removal script Lindsay Evans has created outline.js   If you encounter any issues provide feedback how it works with touch based interfaces has not been investigated much:  using Opera mini and Safari on iPad, the links still show their default activation indicator and the same using webkit on android (feedback from @sideshowbarker), which is the best outcome for usability/accessibility.    The back story The W3C HTML5 specification now states:   element . blur() Unfocuses the element. Use of this method is discouraged. Focus     another element instead.  Do not use this method to hide the focus ring. Do not use any     other method that hides the focus ring from keyboard users,in     particluar do not use a CSS rule to override the ‘outline’ property. Removal of the focus ring leads to serious accessibility issues for users who navigate and interact with interactive content using the keyboard.    The WHATWG Living Standard makes claims it provides advice on how to remove focus outlines in an ‘accessible manner’:  The W3C HTML specification omits some advice about how to remove focus outlines in an accessible manner (instead only urging     authors not to remove them without giving an  alternative to address     the “they’re ugly” use case), because of a working     group chair decision from March 2012.  The WHATWG HTML living standard continues to state:  element . blur()Unfocuses the element. Use of this method is discouraged. Focus another element instead. Do not use this method to hide the focus ring if you find the  focus ring unsightly. Instead, use a CSS rule to override the ‘outline’  property. (Be aware, however, that this makes the page significantly  less usable for some people, especially those with reduced vision who  use focus outlines to help them navigate the page.) For example, to hide the outline from links, you could use: :link:focus, :visited:focus { outline: none; }  The WHATWG HTML living standard does not contain advice on how to remove focus outlines in an ‘accessible manner’ By its own admission the ‘living standard’ states the recommended alternative to using .blur() is bad for accessibility:  Be aware, however, that this makes the page significantly  less usable for some people, especially those with reduced vision who  use focus outlines to help them navigate the page.  Note: This warning also contains a factual innacuracy as use of outline:none makes the page significantly less accessible to any keyboard only user,  not only those with reduced vision. Not providing a visible indication  of focus makes the user interface unusable for keyboard only users in any  circumstance where the page has more than a few focusable elements.

Notes on Guidelines For Speech accessible HTML for Dragon NaturallySpeaking  Posted on Sunday, 13 October 2013 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   In a recent tweet Jared Smith linked to Guidelines For Speech accessible HTML for Dragon NaturallySpeaking (PDF) A ‘White Paper’ published in 2009 by Nuance containing ‘guidance’ on how to code HTML to support users of its product.  Note that I could not find a link to this document from the Nuance web site and that I could not find a link to more recent guidance on this subject from Nuance. Speech-accessible HTML – http://t.co/hlh5dxFv30 In inaccessible PDF, rather ironically. — Jared Smith (@jared_w_smith) October 10, 2013 // <![CDATA[  // ]]&gt;  Unsafe guidance Unfortunately the cited document contains inaccuracies that contradict the web standards for HTML and accessibility and do not correspond to interoperable implementations of accessibility support in browsers. Examples of the problematic guidance are detailed below: Nuance guidance on the a element anchor elements (<a>…</a>) Text links (anchor elements) naturally provide the text that should be spoken for speech access, and therefore require no specification beyond the guidelines above. If for some reason an anchor element has no text, Dragon NaturallySpeaking uses its ALT text [emphasis mine] Guidance notes: The alt attribute is not a conforming attribute for the a element in HTML. i.e. it throws an error when validating the HTML document code. More importantly it is not used in calculating the accessible name (label) for the a element. What this means is that the alt attribute in this case will not be exposed to assistive technology via the agreed standard methods for identifying an accessible name for an HTML a element. Nuance advice on images used as the sole content of a link Two general approaches can be taken to associate text with an image link. First, you can assign ALT or TITLE attributes [emphasis mine] containing the text that corresponds to the image (or to each individual area of an image map). Guidance notes: Any image (including one that is the sole content of a link) MUST have an alt attribute that provides an appropriate text alternative. The title attribute MUST NOT be used as an alternative to the alt attribute. The same applies to an area element, it MUST have an alt attribute. Refer to the following for detailed guidance:  4.8.1.1.3 A link or button containing nothing but an image 4.8.1.1.12 A group of images that form a single larger picture with links 4.8.1.1.17 Icon Images  Nuance advice on button labels Buttons (<input type=”submit | button” | reset | image”>) Dragon uses the button’s caption (the VALUE attribute) as the spoken text, as well as ALT or TITLE attributes if any. Guidance notes: The alt attribute is ONLY valid on input type=image, it is not valid on submit, button or reset. More importantly the alt attribute is only used as the accessible name for an input when it is type=image. Nuance advice on edit controls edit Controls (text entry Fields) (<input type=”text | password”>) While Dragon provides commands such as “click text field” to navigate to text fields, it is preferable to be able to reach each field directly by speaking. These elements have NAME attributes that can be used as the spoken text. Although these elements do not typically have ALT [emphasis mine] or TITLE attributes, you can include those attributes as well. Using the ALT [emphasis mine] or TITLE attribute may be preferable in software-generated HTML, which often assigns unpronounceable, programmatic NAME values that cannot be easily changed without breaking the functionality of the document. Guidance notes: The name attribute is not designed to be used as a human readable label for ANY element. It IS NOT used in the accessible name calculation for any element. The alt attribute is not valid or used in the accessible name calculation for input elements other than type=image. Use of the title attribute to provide an accessible label for a control is only recommended under very particular circumstances due to its inaccessible and unusable implementation in most browsers and operating systems. Conclusion The document ‘Guidelines For Speech accessible HTML for Dragon NaturallySpeaking’ includes poor guidance for HTML developers that contradicts web standards and may lead to less accessible content. As such it should not be used or cited as a credible resource.

Things are set to improve with SVG2, but ARIA can be used now to improve the accessibility of simple SVG.  SVG accessibility SVG includes two elements for providing short and long text descriptions: The title and desc elements.  <body> ... <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg>    <title>Circle</title>    <desc>Large red circle with a black border</desc>    <circle cy=\"60\" r=\"55\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"red\" /> </svg> …... </body>  Browser support for SVG accessibility Note: Thanks to Adobe for commissioning the research and for permission to share the data! In the browser’s accessibility API, the title and desc elements should map to the accessible name and accessible description respectively. The browser’s accessibility API should also expose the role of the SVG, so screen readers can correctly identify it. Testing across recent browsers indicates that the title and desc elements, and the role of the SVG element, are not represented consistently in browser accessibility APIs.  SVG title and desc element mapping in browsers   Expected result IE10 (Windows) FF25 (Windows) Chrome 30 (Windows) Chrome 30 (Mac/iOS) Safari 6 (Mac/iOS) Chrome 30 (Android)   title = accessible name Yes No (is accessible description) No No No N/A   desc = accessible description Yes No (is accessible name) No No No N/A   SVG role = graphic/diagram Yes (graphic) Yes (diagram) No No No N/A    Internet Explorer 10+ (on Windows) is the only browser to correctly expose both the title and desc elements and the SVG role through its accessibility API. Firefox 25 (on Windows) is close, but it computes the accessible name and accessible description the wrong way around. The computation issue has been resolved but is not yet available. Screen reader support for SVG accessibility Screen reader support is largely dependent on the information exposed through the browser’s accessibility API. The fact that information is available through the accessibility API doesn’t mean that a screen reader automatically recognises it though. The desired behaviour is that the screen reader can navigate to the SVG image, identify it  as an image, and that the accessible name and accessible description are announced.  SVG title and desc support in screen readers   Expected result IE10 (Windows) FF25 (Windows) Chrome 30 (Windows) Chrome 30 (Mac/iOS) Safari 6 (Mac/iOS) Chrome 30 (Android)   Jaws 15 Yes No No N/A N/A N/A   NVDA 2013.2 on Windows Partial No No N/A N/A N/A   VoiceOver on OSX N/A N/A N/A No No N/A   VoiceOver on iOS N/A N/A N/A No No N/A   TalkBack on Android N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A No    Jaws 15 and Internet Explorer 10 is the best combination at present, although nested SVG images are not well supported. NVDA and Internet Explorer present the role, title and desc, but support is erratic with multiple images announced and repetition of the title and desc. In all other browser/screen reader combinations the SVG is ignored. ARIA enhanced SVG accessibility It is possible to enhance the information exposed through the browser accessibility APIs with a handful of ARIA attributes. Specifically role and aria-labelledby.  <body> ... <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg role=\"img\" aria-labelledby=\"title  desc\">    <title id=\"title\">Circle</title>    <desc id=\"desc\">Large red circle with a black border</desc>    <circle role=\"presentation\" cy=\"60\" r=\"55\" stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\"     fill=\"red\" /> </svg> … </body>  Putting role=\"img\" on the svg element ensures it is identified as a graphic. Using aria-labelledby referencing the id values of the title and desc elements provides the accessible name and accessible description. The aria-describedby attribute is not used in this case, due to support issues and the practical outcome is the same, i.e. When a screen reader user encounters the SVG image, the accessible name is announced followed by the accessible description. The presentation role is applied to the circle element. This removes its role of graphic. Although this might seem unintuitive, the img role needs to be applied to the SVG element instead, as it makes support across screen readers more robust. SVG ‘image’ represented as multiple images The presence of multiple images may be announced by a screen reader because each child element of an SVG element, <path> for example, is represented as an image in the accessibility tree. For example the SVG version of the HTML5 logo is represented as a container image with 10 nested images: Accessibility tree representation of the SVG version of the HTML5 logo. As noted above, by using role=presentation on the child elements of the svg element, the role of the nested graphics can be hidden. It’s also worth mentioning that if the SVG contained the text element, the role of presentation wouldn’t need to be applied to it. The the text element is represented as just that – text. Browser support for ARIA enhanced SVG Enhancing the SVG with ARIA dramatically changes the information that is available through browser accessibility APIs.  ARIA enhanced SVG title and desc support in browsers>   Expected result IE10 (Windows) FF25 (Windows) Chrome 30 (Windows) Chrome 30 (Mac/iOS) Safari 6 (Mac/iOS) Chrome 30 (Android)   title + desc/aria-labelledby = accessible name Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes   svg role = graphic/image Yes (graphic) Yes (graphic) Yes (graphic) Yes (image) Yes (image) Yes (image)    Screen reader support for ARIA enhanced SVG The addition of ARIA also improves the level of support provided by screen readers.  ARIA enhanced SVG title and desc support in screen readers   Expected result IE10 (Windows) FF25 (Windows) Chrome 30 (Windows) Chrome 30 (Mac/iOS) Safari 6 (Mac/iOS) Chrome 30 (Android)   Jaws 15 on Windows Yes Yes Yes N/A N/A N/A   NVDA 2013.2 on Windows Yes Yes Yes N/A N/A N/A   VoiceOver on OSX N/A N/A N/A Yes Yes N/A   VoiceOver on iOS N/A N/A N/A Yes Yes N/A   TalkBack on Android N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Yes    In most cases screen reader support is now available. The notable exception is Jaws in Firefox or Chrome. Jaws support for Chrome is based on its Firefox scripts, so given this and the availability of the correct information from the browser, it appears to be a bug in Jaws. These techniques take a small step towards more accessible SVG1.1. With Rich Schwerdtfeger and IBM leading the effort to introduce ARIA and tabindex support in SVG2.0, the outlook for SVG accessibility support is even better. Thanks again to Adobe for commissioning the original research, and Steve Faulkner for doing all the hard work!  The Browser Accessibility Tree  Posted on Monday, 26 January 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Testing   The accessibility tree and the DOM tree are parallel structures.   Roughly speaking the accessibility tree is a subset of the DOM tree. It includes the user interface objects of the user agent and the objects of the document. Accessible objects are created in the accessibility tree for every DOM element that should be exposed to an assistive technology, either because it may fire an accessibility event or because it has a property, relationship or feature which needs to be exposed. Generally if something can be trimmed out it will be, for reasons of performance and simplicity. For example, a <span> with just a style change and no semantics may not get its own accessible object, but the style change will be exposed by other means. source: Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1  Show me the accessibility tree! On Windows you can use an object inspection tool such as aViewer to view and interrogate the Accessibility Tree and roles, states and properties, in Firefox, Internet Explorer and Chrome.

Internet Explorer Accessibility Tree (video element)  Chrome Accessibility tree (video element)  Note: You can also see a full dump of the accessibility tree including roles, states and properties using the Chrome://accessibility tab Notes: The example used is unusual as the video element has a complex UI which includes controls in the accessibility tree that are in the Shadow DOM. Each browser presents a different accessibility tree based on the differing content of its shadow DOM. This occurs for 2 reasons:  Each browser has differing UI for the video player controls. There are differences in the way the video element and its controls are mapped to Platform accessibility APIs and which APIs are used.   #A11Y Slackers  Posted on Thursday, 9 July 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: EdgeTag: HTMLTag: Internet ExplorerTag: Windows   A ubiquitous issue for people involved in moving the web forward is that there is always too much to do. Identifiying and prioritising tasks is critical. Identifying is fairly easy, prioritising not so. Priorities depend on both internal and external factors often beyond our control. I have a tendency to be critical of huge, profit making, corporations that are involved in moving the web forward who de-prioritise accessibility [who appear to de-prioritise accessibility]. It’s not always a useful trait, but it’s who I am. I am also aware that many of the people who I interact with, while working for these corporations, are doing their best to make accessibility a priority despite the internal and external factors beyond their control. A current example is Microsoft, what we know is that Windows 10 will be with us at the end of the month along with a new much improved standards based browser called Edge. What is known is that Microsoft is a huge corporation with a long history of accessibility support in its software and also a long history of broken sub-standard accessibility support for HTML in its browser (IE). IE has come along way in web standards support in the last few years, the  same cannot be said for the accessibility branch of web standards. There is the future promise that with Edge accessibility web standards support will be much improved, but as is often the case due to corporate prioritisation, and resulting provision of resources and expertise, Windows 10 will arrive with a brand new browser, with broken accessibility support and advice to continue to use the old IE browser whose support, while broken, is more robust because assistive technology have had a lot of time to hack around the brokeness. It is instructive to understand that when an organization genuinely prioritises the needs of users with disabilities, anything is possible:  To all you Windows 10 enthusiastic screen reader users out there, it looks like Firefox will be there for you. It will be accessible. #a11y — Marco Zehe (@MarcoInEnglish) July 6, 2015  Further Reading Windows 10: Advisories from screen reader developers and final thoughts Addendum It was unfair of me to imply that the current Microsoft browser team are #a11y slackers. They are doing all they can under difficult circumstances to bring a modern, robust accessibility implementation to Edge, something that unfortunately Microsoft failed to do in the history of IE.  Results from the main landmark survey  Posted on Tuesday, 30 January 2018 by Léonie Watson  Category: Development    When the HTML main element was created, it was intended to represent the single chunk of content that made up the main content area of the page. This definition was disputed for a long time, so in an effort to have some user data to feed into the discussion, we ran a short survey to find out what screen reader users expect in terms of the main element.  The survey focused on screen reader users because they benefit from the semantics of the HTML main element. The element maps to the main landmark role, which means that screen reader users can navigate to it (using a keyboard shortcut), and identify it as the main content area once they get there. We asked two questions:  When you navigate by landmarks, do you expect more than one main landmark on a page? When you find a main landmark, do you look for additional main landmarks on the page?  The survey was open between 5 and 12 January 2018, and 238 people completed it during that time. 161 people (68%) said they only expected one main landmark on a page. 163 people (68.5%) said that if they found a main landmark, they did not continue looking for others on the page. This suggests that a reasonable majority of screen reader users agree with the HTML specification, and are also confident that authors are following standards. The fact that 77 people (32%) expected more than one main landmark was interesting. The survey didn’t investigate the reasons why, but implementation data gathered at the time of the survey suggests that experience isn’t a candidate. From a sample of about 1.5 million pages, just 1,500 (0.1%) had multiple main elements (compared to about 225,000 (15%) with one main element). This suggests that a considerable majority of authors also agree with the way the main element is defined in the HTML specification, and that screen reader users’ confidence is well placed. The dispute has since been resolved, and the WHATWG HTML standard now aligns with the original definition of the main element in the W3C HTML specification.

HTML5 Accessibility Chops: title attribute use and abuse  Posted on Monday, 23 January 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   For the past 7 years myself and others have banged on about the trouble with the title attribute in regards to accessibility and usability. Bottom line is that it is not well supported in browsers and its usefulness is severely compromised as a consequence. All browser vendors are aware of the issues in regards to keyboard and touch based interfaces and yet have made no movement or commitment to implement improvements in the 19 years since it was originally specified in HTML. HTML5 codifies the authoring of inaccessible content Furthermore we still have the authoritative document for understanding how to use and implement HTML, illustrating and advocating title attribute use in terms that promote and codify inaccessible content. While at the same time the HTML5 specification does not mention the real world documented usage methods for the title attribute that actually help users with disabilities, because the editor of HTML5 refuses to allow it. The W3C HTML5 Recommendation warns against use of the title attribute: Warning! Relying on the title attribute is currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by this specification (e.g. requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to appear, which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or tablet). Examples of HTML title attribute use and abuse In the linked document title attribute usage examples I have provided some data of title attribute use on a range of popular sites. The examples illustrate that the title attribute is widely misused. When to use the title attribute: simplified  Do not use the title attribute, on any element, for any text  that you want all users to have access to. Only use it to label a form control when the same text is provided as visible text. Do not use it on a link to provide information that may be important to any user. If in doubt, read: Using the HTML title attribute  Further reading:  Reasons to not allow the title attribute to be used as a substitute for the alt attribute in HTML5 Reason to not promote the use of the title attribute for footnotes in HTML5 Reasons for not promoting the title attribute as a container for captions in HTML5 title attribute definition does not match reality   MAKING THE GUI TALK (1991) by Rich Schwerdtfeger  Posted on Tuesday, 20 January 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Seminal how-to article on development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) Screen Readers for Windows OS/2 and the X Windows System.   This article originally appeared (in print) in BYTE magazine, December 1991.  Reproduced with the kind permission of its author Rich Schwerdtfeger  New technology holds promise for blind and learning-disabled people who live in a GUI-oriented world AUTHOR: Richard S. Schwerdtfeger More than 120,000 people in the U.S. are legally blind, according to figures put out by the American Foundation for the Blind in New York. In addition, the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C., states that 10 percent to 15 percent of the U.S. population have learning disabilities. For some years now, to communicate with the sighted world, blind people have used computers via screen-reader systems (SRDs) that can access a physical display buffer of characters and orally present the information (see “Opening Doors for the Disabled,” August 1990 BYTE). In the past few years, however, the widespread trend toward the development and use of GUIs has caused a multitude of problems for the visually impaired and some learning-disabled people. The advent of GUIs has made it virtually impossible for blind people to use much of the industry’s most popular software and has limited their chances for advancement in the now graphically oriented world. The coming of GUIs has left some SRDs with no means to access graphical information. GUIs do not use a physical display buffer, but instead employ a pixel-based display buffer. Fortunately, new technology is coming into existence to correct this problem. Companies are now enhancing SRDs to work by intercepting low-level graphics commands and constructing a text database that models the display. Developers have created new screen-reader software and combined it with a common user interface. One prototype of this type of application is Screen Reader/PM from IBM. It is an enhancement of the original DOS Screen Reader that the company brought out four years ago. The research project has a current installed base of more than 40 beta-test sites. With a system like this, the disabled user can maneuver a mouse over the display and use the keyboard or a separate keypad, and a voice synthesizer will actually describe an icon the GUI has displayed or the graphical text shown on the screen. This new technology has alleviated many of the problems that GUIs created for blind and some learning-disabled users, and their future now looks much more promising. Recent technological developments are putting the computer back into the hands of blind and learning-disabled people. Also spurring development of adaptive technology for the disabled are two new laws. An amendment to Public Law 506 (29 U.S.C. 794d) states that a company can sell a product to the U.S. government only if that device is accessible to people with disabilities. The Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law by President Bush in 1990, states, in part, that if your company has more than 25 employees, you must provide reasonable accommodation (including technology) in the form of job adaptations for the handicapped. Taking the First Step A package called OutSpoken is available that reads and vocalizes a GUI. It was designed and developed in 1989 by Berkeley Systems (BSI) for the Macintosh GUI. OutSpoken is a screen reader that communicates through voice synthesis with blind users as they move the mouse around the GUI and come in contact with text and graphical objects on the screen. BSI realized that it had to construct a database that the screen- reader software could access. This database, called an off-screen model (OSM), is the conceptual basis for GUI screen readers that vendors are developing today. The advent of OutSpoken was a significant breakthrough for the blind community. Other companies and software developers are considering how to use this new technology to make their systems accessible to the disabled. I will define what an OSM is, how it is created, and how SRDs can access and use it. The information in this article is based on my work on the Screen Reader project at IBM’s T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. Off-Screen Model An OSM is a database reconstruction of what is visible on the screen and also what is not visible on the screen. A database must manage information resources, provide utilities for managing these resources, and supply utilities to access the database. The resources the OSM must manage are text, off-screen bit maps, icons, and cursors. Text is obviously the largest resource the OSM must maintain. It is arranged in the database relative to its position on the display or to the bit map on which it is drawn. This situation gives the model an appearance like that of the conventional display buffer. Each character must have certain information associated with it: foreground and background color; font family and typeface name; point size; and font style, such as bold, italic, strike-out, underscore, and width. Merging text by baseline (i.e., position on the display) gives the model a physical display buffer appearance with which current SRDs are accustomed to working. Therefore, to merge associated text in the database, the model combines text in such a way that characters in a particular window have the same baseline. Each string of text in the OSM has an associated bounding rectangle used for model placement, a window handle, and a handle to indicate whether the text is associated with a particular bit map or the display. GUI text is not always placed directly onto the screen. Text can be drawn into memory in bit-map format and then transferred to the screen. It can also be clipped from a section of the display and saved in memory for placement back onto the screen later. An example of this is a drop-down menu: Text in the area to be overlaid by the menu is transferred to memory and later tranferred back onto the screen when the menu is deleted. The operation required to transfer bit maps is called a BitBlt, or bit block transfer. GUIs use BitBlts for speed. For example, in a drop- down menu, it is much faster to transfer the pixels cut from the screen back onto the screen than to have the application redraw or “paint” that portion of the screen from scratch. Icons are pictorial representations of an idea or object. In the GUI, icons represent many things, ranging from programs that are currently running to objects that receive user input to perform a specific action (e.g., a push button or check box). Icons are read, identified, and then stored as single text images or as completely separate, nontext entities. People who are blind need to be able to use icons the way they use text-in other words, they need to be able to hear a verbal description of each icon. When an application is designed without a provision for keyboard access to particular icons, the blind user needs a mouse to locate the icons. A screen-reader application must be able to track mouse movements, match their positions with OSM icons, and vocalize the associated icon names. The OSM must also provide cursor information so a screen reader can vocalize the user’s cursor position on the display. In windowing systems, more than one application can be displayed on the screen. However, your keyboard input is directed to only one active window at a time. But each active window is often made up of many child windows. The applications cursor is placed in at least one of these child windows. The OSM must keep track of a cursor’s window identification (i.e., handle) so that when a window becomes active, SRDs can determine if it has a cursor and vocalize it. An SRD cursor is the area on the display where the next potential action will occur or where users can enter their next text. An example of a cursor is the blinking insertion bar in an editor or the rectangular highlighting text in a menu of options. The OSM must keep track of the cursor’s screen position, dimensions, the associated text string (i.e., speakable cursor text), and string character position. If the cursor is a blinking insertion bar, its character position is that of the associated character in the OSM string. In this case, the cursor’s text is the entire string. A wide rectangular cursor is called a selector, since it is used to isolate screen text to identify an action. Examples of selector cursors are those used for spreadsheets or drop-down menus. The text that is enclosed within the borders of the selector is the text that the screen reader would speak. Construction Toolkit Now, I’ll build a toolkit of utility functions that you can use for constructing and maintaining the resource information. The software performing the display reconstruction is driven from low- level GUI graphics functions. Therefore, with some exceptions, OSM utilities used to construct and maintain the model appear like operations being performed by the graphics engine. These operations are performed on text or database representations of bit maps, cursors, or icons, as opposed to pictures or actual bit maps. The utilities required to handle text are clipping, erasure, text merger, and text transfer. These tools must handle icons as well as text. Developers do not normally worry about clipping text to the windows in their GUI applications. Text running outside the window must be clipped off by the low-level graphics routines, and the code constructing the model must also perform the same operation. Therefore, the model must provide tools to clip the text to the clip region supplied by the software constructing the model. This region is represented by an array of rectangles defining the visible domain. You can use text-erasing tools when placing one window over another or when you reduce the size of a window. You can use text-merger tools when you combine text with other text having the same handle and screen baseline. Simply put, text is merged into an OSM bit-map representation using common baselines. Performing a BitBlt requires tools to transfer functions for text and cursors-for example, if you are moving a window from one part of the display to another, or when text that was previously drawn to a memory bit map is transferred to the screen. Therefore, tools are also required for moving text between the visible display portion of the database and the nonvisible off-screen portion where OSM representations of bit maps are stored. System Dependent Now, on to building the model. The construction code, called the patch code, is operating-system dependent, because specific patch-code function calls are patched or hooked in with a subset of the low-level graphics calls. The calls to hook are those that draw text; perform BitBlts; save bit maps to display card memory; restore bit maps from display card memory; select and unselect bit maps for drawing; delete bit maps; map display buffers to windows; draw rectangles, boxes, borders, and regions; and update cursors. For each of these graphics calls, you have a corresponding patch function call. The job of these patch functions is to directly mimic the low-level calls by performing the same operations on the model. For instance, the instruction drawtext would draw text on the screen as well as merge text into the model. How you hook these calls depends on the GUI system architecture. X Window System is based on a client/server model. X applications (clients) communicate with the X server by sending and receiving messages over a socket. When the X server initializes, it creates a socket that clients use to establish new connections and returns the socket address to the calling environment. When a new client starts, it uses that socket address to connect to the X server. To establish a new connection, the client connects to the socket and receives a new socket to use for communication. When the X server accepts a connection, it receives a new socket connected only to the new client, leaving the original socket open for new connections. SRD patch software intercepts this communication by changing the socket address that clients use to connect to the X server. New clients use the modified socket address and connect directly to the screen reader instead of the X server. The SRD then connects to the real X server on behalf of the client and manages all socket I/O between the client and server. Screen Reader’s View Regarding the screen reader’s interface to the model, the OSM must notify the SRD of cursor changes and window updates. Cursor changes and window-update notifications are performed either by setting flags, in the case of polling, or by various means of interprocess communication (IPC) on multitasking systems. OSM change notifications result in the SRD’s referring to the OSM to check for important updates. Therefore, the SRD software writer needs to reduce the OSM viewing area to a particular application or window. This area of the model is called a view, and a subset of this view is called a viewport. OSM software must provide tools to set up and maintain views and viewports. An example of the way you use views and viewports is the Lotus 1-2-3/G spreadsheet shown in the screen. To construct a view of the spreadsheet, the SRD must pass the OSM the spreadsheet’s bounding rectangle and all window identifications composing the spreadsheet. The OSM then extracts all view text and sorts it by baseline. The user then might ask the SRD to isolate a specific spreadsheet column for ease of use. Upon such a request, the SRD vocalizes each column (i.e., viewport) entry. Turning On the Lights Here’s an example of how text drawn by an application GUI program is spoken by a screen-reader program. First, an application uses a standard application programming interface call to draw “Hello World” in an OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM) window. The application could use a function called WinDrawText to place the text in the window. The WinDrawText function results in a low-level graphics engine call to GreCharStringPos. For GreCharStringPos, there is a corresponding call to the patch-code function OsmCharStringPos, passing it the same parameters. PM is very helpful in providing many query functions needed to build an OSM node before placing it into the model. The construction code uses functions such as GreGetClipRects and GreQueryFontAttributes to obtain clipping and font information. When the necessary information is acquired from the Gre functions, the patch code then determines the text colors by performing its own color mixing. Next, a database node is constructed. OSM utilities create the node; add the font, color, spacing, text, and text bounds; and clip the node to the region. If the text is still visible, a window handle is retrieved from PM and placed in the node. Finally, OSM utilities are used to merge the text into its proper place in the database-in this case, the visible (displayed) portion. After the text is merged into the OSM, the SRD is notified. Assuming that “Hello World” is in the current view, on the next keystroke command, the blind user could hear the SRD speak what is in the window. If “Hello World” were the only text to be displayed in the window, the user could program the SRD to speak it automatically on update. Twisting Screen Readers’ Arms This is a good time to discuss the effects of making the current screen readers work in the new GUI system environment. Modifying current screen readers to accommodate the new GUI software is no easy task. Most of these systems run under DOS as TSR programs. Unlike DOS, leading GUI software operates in multitasking environments where applications are running concurrently. The SRD performs a juggling act as each application gets the user’s input. Since an SRD is a new multitasking application itself, it must use forms of IPC, like queues. PM and Windows use message queuing so that windows can receive keyboard and mouse input and communicate between other windows. A program remains dormant most of the time, until it receives a message. Operating systems like OS/2 provide for multiple full-screen sessions as well as a GUI. Due to the protected-mode environment of systems like OS/2, SRD developers must now write device drivers to access the protected full-screen display-buffer memory of non-GUI applications. With macros or a full-profile language used by current fully functional SRD systems, you can program how each application is read to the user. The blind user or the SRD developer must write profiles to employ multitasking constructs and be able to distinguish GUI constructs like window classes for various system and application controls. Writing new profiles for these systems will require major rewrites to the existing software base and is a hair-raising experience. If you resize the window, text or child windows within the frame may disappear. The writer can’t always count on the text or icons remaining in the window. Capabilities and Shortcomings With the new technology, screen readers will be able to work with most popular GUI software packages. These include the new GUI versions of Microsoft Word and Excel or Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows and PM-any application that relies mainly on text or icons. The new screen-reader world still won’t be a utopian one. The disabled will have problems with packages such as CorelDraw, which draws pictures as well as text. It includes no way to describe the pictures to the blind user. Disabled people will also have trouble with other packages that cannot tell them the location of graphical images on the screen. In addition, some software packages construct screen text from lines rather than from fixed fonts. In this case, the application performs the drawing instead of placing a fixed font on the screen. Access to this text requires that character recognition be built into off-screen models. What Else Is Needed? To fully exploit the new technology, developers should make OSM libraries accessible to the public. Access to an OSM would allow screen-reader developers to tailor their systems to people with learning disabilities. As an example, a modified screen reader could say “file disposer” rather than “wastebasket” for the Macintosh GUI, an enhancement that would help learning-disabled people who have problems translating symbolic representations into meaning. Other screen-reader companies will want to develop their own OSMs. Developing the hook code for AIX or PM is a very large undertaking. Therefore, GUI systems should provide hook facilities that allow applications to intercept the low-level graphics calls and construct their own OSMs. Release of this new software and promulgation of the new laws will motivate computer companies to develop more accessible systems. But there is still much more to be done. Sneak Preview For the past year, I have been part of a project team whose goal is to convert IBM’s Screen Reader for DOS to Screen Reader OS/2 and PM. In particular, I’ve been involved in developing PM’s OSM. Commenting on the destiny of Screen Reader/PM, IBM’s Jim Thatcher, research staff member and project manager, says, “Currently, Screen Reader for PM is an IBM Research Division prototype being used on the job by more than 40 people in IBM and other companies. It hasn’t yet been determined whether or not it will become a product. However, we are demonstrating it at major conferences, including The World Congress on Technology in Washington, D.C., this month, and it is entered in the Johns Hopkins National Search for Computing to Assist Persons with Disabilities.” (See the text box “Chaotic Progress” .) IBM’s Screen Reader/PM is the first fully functional SRD for a GUI. It is fully programmable. Project team members have completely rewritten the profile access language to accommodate PM and OS/2 multitasking constructs. Screen Reader/PM automatically switches profiles as the blind user switches between applications, either on the PM GUI or in full-screen sessions. The group is also porting Screen Reader/PM to AIX and X. Screen Reader/AIX is to be the first GUI screen reader for a Unix-based system. With this software, the blind user will also be able to work with Motif. Development of Screen Reader/AIX marks the beginning of a portable OSM between two large multitasking operating systems. Berkeley Systems is rewriting OutSpoken for Windows 3.0 and developing a portable OSM called the GUI Access Toolkit. This toolkit will make it possible for third-party developers to create and market new access software for Windows and the Macintosh without having to develop their own OSMs. These efforts forecast a new era of independence for the visually impaired community. For the first time, blind and visually impaired people will be able to work with multitasking systems. They will be able to perform tasks such as formatting a disk and running a spreadsheet calculation while they are logged onto a mainframe and listening to the daily announcements in a window. With software like IBM’s Screen Reader/AIX, blind people will be able to use workstations. This access will open many new jobs now unattainable by visually impaired people.  Richard S.

In the enthusiasm for all the other HTML5 structural elements, there is a growing tendency for the section element to be used whether it’s the right element for the job or not.  The section element is not a div The HTML5 section element is not a replacement for a div. It’s easy to think it should be, because all the other structural elements that were introduced in HTML5 (header, footer, main etc.) replaced all the divs we used to use to denote those areas of a page. The HTML5 specification is clear about this “The section element is not a generic container element. When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the div element instead.” If you’re wondering why it makes a difference, the answer is semantics. The div is a semantically neutral element, the section element is not. The section element is exposed through the browser’s accessibility API, and that information is picked up by assistive technologies and communicated to users. For example the Jaws screen reader announces “Region” each time it encounters the section element. It announces “Region” rather than “Section” because the section element maps to the role of region (and it’s the role that’s exposed via the accessibility APIs). The section element is a thematic container The section element is a container for content that has a related theme. The HTML5.0 specification has this to say: “A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.” At the time of writing the HTML 5.1 nightly specification provides even more clarity: “The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. The theme of each section should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1 – h6 element) as a descendant of the section element.” The section element should have a heading The heading is important. If you can’t think of a suitable heading for the content within a section element, there’s a good chance you shouldn’t be using the section element at all. Time to consider a div instead. The heading is important for another reason. It can be used to increase the semantic information that’s available about the section element through the browser’s accessibility API. Applying the aria-labelledby property to the section element and pairing it with the heading’s id attribute, enhances the information that’s available to assistive technologies. <section aria-labelledby=\"sectionHeading\"> <h2 id=\"sectionHeading\">Weather report</h2> ... </section> Now the name of the region is exposed via the accessibility APIs for ATs to use. For example, the Jaws screen reader would announce “Weather report region” if it were to encounter the section element shown above. To keep your pages semantically clean, and user friendly for people using assistive technologies, keep these things in mind:  Don’t use the section element if you just need a hook for styling or scripting. Use the section element when your content has a theme. Give your section element a heading and associate the two programmatically.   IE 8: alt change and longdesc weirdness  Posted on Saturday, 8 March 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTMLTag: Internet Explorer   Update for IE 8b2 I have updated the results for IE8 b2, and included tests for input type=”image”  Tests and results for HTML 4.01 transitional. Tests and results for HTML 4.01 strict.  update end.  Reading through the What’s New in Internet Explorer 8, this caught my attention: The alt attribute is no longer displayed as the image tooltip when the browser is running in IE8 mode. Instead, the target of the longDesc attribute is used as the tooltip if present; otherwise, the title is displayed. The alt attribute is still used as the Active Accessibility name, and the title attribute is used as the fallback name only if alt is not present. So IE 8 falls into line with the HTML 4.01 specification and other major browsers in regards to not using alt attribute content as a tooltip – good news. Then it starts to get strange “instead the target of the longdesc attribute is used as the tooltip if present“. So now we have support for longdesc in IE8?? But how is that going to work… Does the tooltip show the text content of the target file? Does it show structure and formatting? Just when it was thought that the longdesc had been assigned to HTML heaven, Microsft have decided to support it… Testing support To test out the changed alt and added longdesc support a test page with some combinations of alt, longdesc and title was created. The results were mixed:  The alt is not displayed as a tooltip when using HTML 4.01 strict DOCTYPE or XHTML DOCTYPE’s. The alt is displayed as a tooltip when using a HTML 4.01 transitional DOCTYPE. The longdesc attribute target URI content is not displayed as a tooltip as stated in the documentation. The URI contained in the longdesc attribute is included in the MSAA Description property ((accDescription) information about the control that doesn’t fit into any other field). In previous IE versions it was not.  So the implemenation of the longdesc is not complete (or perhaps the testing is at fault), but clearly something is going on with the longdesc in IE8 as evidenced when you look under the hood at the MSAA information. Note: Having re-read the documentation and discussed it with my colleague Gez Lemon who pointed out to me my mis-interpretation of the mircrosoft documentation: The URI will be displayed as a string in the tooltip, not the content of the URI as I interpretated it as initially. this would explain the URI being in the MSAA Description property.  Circumventing Hegemony in the HTML WG  Posted on Friday, 4 July 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Standards Tag: HTML   Raising Issues In order to raise an issue or proposal in regards to the HTML5 specification you do not have to be a member of the W3C HTML Working Group (HTML WG). Anyone can simply enter a bug into the HTML Bugzilla. If the proposal or issue is rejected by those that control the specification and the issue is related to accessibility, you can refer the issue to the W3C Protocols and Formats Working Group (PF WG). Probably the best method is to subscribe to and send an email to the WAI-XTECH mailing list. I would suggest that you take this course of action if you consider that the issue raised to be substantive and it has not been given appropriate consideration due to lack of accessibility expertise or understanding of the obligations of the HTML WG to ensure deliverables will satisfy accessibility requirements. The PF WGÂ is responsible for ensuring accessibility considerations are taken into account in all specifications produced within the W3C. Â If the PF WG considers the matter substantive they may formally request that the HTML WG, not just the editor, reconsider the matter. This may lead to the HTML WG as a whole having a vote on the matter, that is up to the HTML WG Chairs to decide. By following this course of action you at least guaranteed that the issue will be discussed by a group within the W3C that has expertise in relation to accessibility and the web. It will also be considered employing the W3C consensus process, which is not a process currently used in practice within the HTML WG. W3C Member Organisations You can also bring matters to the attention of W3C member organisations, so when it comes time to review and vote on the HTML5 specification before publication, those organisations can make an informed decision about whether the specification takes the accessibility requirements of their constituents into account. W3C members include organisations such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind and vision australia who represent the interest of people with disabilities, so you can voice your concerns with them directly.

You can spend as much or as little time contributing; you don’t need to read every e-mail on subjects you don’t care about, you don’t need to call in or attend face-to-face meetings. In fact, the W3C has stated in the group’s charter that no binding decisions will be made at meetings; you are guaranteed equal say whether you are present or not. To join, you have to go through the following steps: If you don’t work for a W3C member organisation:  If you do not already have a W3C Access Account login and password (check if there is an account associated with your address),     complete the Public     Access Request Form. You     should receive your W3C login name and password within two (2) business     days. After you receive your W3C login name, complete the W3C Invited Expert     Application. You should receive a reply within ten (10) business     days. If your request is accepted, you will receive an invitation with     additional instructions for formally joining the group. You will then be able to complete the form for     joining and participating in the HTML Working Group as an Invited  Expert, at which point you are a bona fide member! Remember to read the HTML Working Group Charter, invited expert and collaborators agreement and Policy for Approval of Invited Experts documents.  You will also be subscribed automatically to the group’s mailing lists. If you do work for a W3C member organisation: The steps above don’t apply to you. Instead, you have to follow these instructions. What about HTML5 Accessibility? The W3C HTML Working Group has a dedicated accessibility task force (mailing list) working on a range of HTML5 accessibility issues:  ARIA Integration Bug Triage Canvas Media Text Alternatives  Note: Any HTML working group member can join the accessibility taskforce and are encouraged to! Based on Ian Hickson’s post (2007) and Instructions for joining the HTML Working Group  CSS Editor bookmarklet for IE  Posted on Thursday, 29 November 2007 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: CSS   For times when CSS styles need to be tested, on the fly, in Internet Explorer, the CSS editor bookmarklet can come in handy. It was originally developed fromÂ the test stylesÂ bookmarklet by Jesse Ruderman. When Internet Explorer 7 came along it ceased to work, but after much fiddling around I was able to get it working in IE 7. The CSS editor has the same functionality as the “test styles” function on the Web Accessibility Toolbar. What The CSS Editor bookmarklet does  When activated it opens in a new window If it can find any style sheets in current page it will list the style rule names in a select list. Choose a style rule to edit by selecting an item from the list and pressing the edit button. The style rules will be inserted into the edit area. EditÂ the rules and press the update button, the changes will be applied to the page. Modified rules within the edit area can be applied to other pages on the same site by pressing the update button once a page has loaded. Remove the changed styles by pressing the clear button. Close the editor by pressing the close button.  Limitations  It’s a bit clunky Works in Internet Explorer only. Pop up blockers must be turned off for it to function. Does not work on framed pages. Does not list @import style sheet rules. You can still edit style rules that are not listed by pasting them into the edit area. Although it can be used on local files, needs an internet connection to work.  What has it got to do with accessibility? It’s keyboard accessible. It can beÂ used to tweak colours on sites so sufficient contrast examples can be provided. Example focus rules can also quickly be applied to demonstrate clear indications of focus on links. Relative units can be applied to text and other page elements, Amongst other things.

For example, a blog post about the JAWS screen reader (amongst other things) and how poorly it supports the reading of paragraph’s in HTML, is being cited to re-inforce arguments in an opinion piece about web accessibility, which in turn is being cited in other debates. In attempt to introduce a little perspective, here is some information about how JAWS reads text. JAWS support for the HTML p element. Users can navigate content via the p element in HTML, by using the P (move to next p element) and Shift-P (move to the previous p element) keys. When these commands are used, JAWS will move to the next or previous p element and read the text contained in that p element and then stop reading. The user can then move to and start reading the next paragraph by pressing the P key. Using this command, JAWS will stop reading at the end of each paragraph independent of style or punctuation. This was tested with JAWS 8.0 and 9.0 on Windows XP using a test page. The “Say All” command The “Say all” command INS+DWN ARROW, is a more general command that applies to desktop applications and other situations where text can be read as well as HTML documents. Using this command JAWS will simply start reading from the top of the document, without pausing, until it reaches the end of the document. For example when a page first loads in a browser JAWS will start reading from the top of the page automatically or the user may invoke the “Say All” command. It will then read all text and text alternatives found on the page. The user can modify the progess of the reading by using the right and left SHIFT keys . Depending on the preference the user has set in the “Say All By” verbosity options, pressing the SHIFT keys will have different effects:  Line with Pauses: This option reads by line, pausing slightly at the end of each line. Line without Pauses: This option allows for smoother reading. Sentence: Select this option for applications in which SayAll sounds choppy. This moves the pauses between elements to the ends of sentences, and makes the reading sound smoother. Paragraph: This option is very useful in large documents as you can press the right SHIFT key to quickly move through the paragraphs without needing to interrupt SayAll.  The user can stop the “Say All” at anytime (by pressing the CTRL key) and navigate the content using the many other methods available. Addendum As a further test of JAWS support for the p element in HTML documents, the JAWS ‘Skim Reading’ feature was tested. When the CTRL+INS+DWN ARROW command is used, JAWS should read the first sentence of each paragraph (other preferences also available). Using the test page, it was found that JAWS announced the first sentence of each paragragh regardless of punctuation (for the last sentence in each paragraph) or visual formatting.

WCAG 2.0 parsing error bookmarklet  Posted on Thursday, 2 February 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: WCAG   While reading Jared Smith’s excellent article WCAG Next I was drawn to the following statement “next to impossible to evaluate” in reference to the checking of WCAG 2.0 success criterion 4.1.1 Parsing.  It is true (as far as I know) that there is no currently available dedicated service or software for checking 4.1.1 Parsing. What I do and advise clients to do is use the W3C validation service to check their code as the checks required for parsing criterion conformance are a subset of the checks that are made when validating HTML code. Identifying relevant errors and warnings A problem with using a standard HTML validator to check for this subset is that many other conformance errors and warnings are also reported and while these may or may not be important to fix, they are not a requirement within the scope of the success criterion. What I have been doing is checking pages against the HTML5 doctype as this minimizes the occurance of errors and warnings that are unrelated to parsing, but still a page can contain many non parsing errors, making it difficult to identify the relevant results. I have also had discussions with Mike Smith (W3C Nu Markup Validation Service) and Henri Sivonen (Validator.nu) about providing a method to filter conformance results to display only parsing issues. There are apperently some design reasons why this would be difficult (not impossible) from a backend code perspective, so I thought a reasonable place to start would be with a client side script that filtered the display of results from a validator. Parsing error bookmarklet The WCAG parsing only bookmarklet is an experimental script that loops through the results displayed when using W3C Nu Markup Validation Service. It looks for certain text strings in the results output and if it does not find them in the text for a particular result it hides that result using CSS display:none. Check results other than the followoing are filtered:  Elements have complete start and end tags Elements are nested according to their specifications Elements do not contain duplicate attributes Any IDs are unique Unquoted attributes (under certain circumstances) Duplicate attributes Mismatched quotes on attributes Attributes not space seperated Mismatched element start and end tags malformed attributes  Trying out the parsing only bookmarklet  save the WCAG parsing only as a bookmark. open the W3C Nu Markup Validation Service in your browser validate a page (test page) activate the bookmarklet To view the unfiltered list of results again – refresh the page you can download the parsing.js code HTML conformance checking and result filtering is also built in to the Web Accessibility Toolbar 2012  WARNING This is an experiment only, due to various constraints the method used to filter the results is not the most robust as it relies upon text string matching. Note: this experiment would not have been possible without the help of my friends and colleagues Hans Hillen and Gez Lemon, who although they thought the method used was crappy, helped me anyway.  HTML5  Accessibility Chops: SVG text alternative example  Posted on Wednesday, 17 August 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The W3C HTML5 specification contains an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) based interactive Venn diagram. The diagram illustrates the relationship between HTML content categories. Currently the content and interactivity of the diagram is not accessible to some users. A bug SVG content model VENN diagram needs to be made accessible was filed. The HTML5 editors’ response: Status: Rejected Change Description: no spec change Rationale: The entire diagram is completely redundant with information already in the spec. The spec itself is its alternative text. It’s just a way to expose the information to visual users in a way optimised for visual users. Non-visual users already have the information presented in a way optimised for them. There are a few issues with the response:  It assumes that a text description of the relationships between content categories depicted in the diagram has no value for ‘non-visual’ users. It assumes that either users are ‘visual’ or ‘non-visual’, when in fact many people with vision impairments and indeed even those considered legally blind have some vision. It makes the somewhat bizarre claim that the 800 pages of the HTML5 specification is an appropriate text alternative for the information depicted in the diagram, while at the same time providing a partial text alternative for the img element fallback content. It does not consider the issue for keyboard users.  SVG fallback content  Code for fallback content: <img alt=\"Sectioning content, heading content, phrasing content, and embedded content are all types of flow content. Embedded content is also a type of phrasing content.\" src=\"http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/images/content-venn.png\"> The fallback content is an image, due to the way browsers support fallback content on the object element (used to display the SVG) it is not available to anyone unless the browser does not support SVG. The current experience for screen reader users Note: SVG content has little accessibility support in browsers and assistive technology. The following is announced when using NVDA and Firefox to access the Venn diagram: Note: the text content immediately before and after the Venn diagram is included to provide context. These categories are related as follows: IFrame  http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/images/content-venn.svg out of IFrame Other categories are also used for specific purposes, e.g. form   controls are specified using a number of categories to define common   requirements. Some elements have unique requirements and do not fit   into any particular category. From the example above it is obvious that the current content does not make sense. A suggested solution  Provide a description of the relationships in text below the diagram which is available to ALL users Provide links in the description that point to the same information for ALL users, that is currently only available, in context, for some users.  Example: These categories are related as follows:  [suggested description start] Sectioning content, heading content, phrasing content, interactive content and  embedded content are all types of flow content.    A subset of metadata content is also flow content. Embedded content  is  also phrasing content. Subsets of interactive and metadata content  are   phrasing content. A subset of  the interactive content which is    phrasing content is also embedded content. [suggested description end] Other categories are also used for specific purposes, e.g. form    controls are specified using a number of categories to define common    requirements. Some elements have unique requirements and do not fit    into any particular category. Notes:  Links to the listing of elements in each category have been added in the suggested descriptive text. These links provide access for keyboard and AT users to the same level of detail for each category as is provided in the diagram for mouse users. This may not be an exact replication of the interactivity, but it is an improvement on what is offered currently. The fallback image, used for demonstrative purposes here, has a modified text alternative, taking onto account its modified context: <img src=\"content-venn.png\" alt=\"venn diagram depicting content category relationships\">  Addendum I have looked into how to label the venn diagram so it is not  announced as “IFrame http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/images/content-venn.svg out of IFrame” by NVDA. Adding a title=\"venn diagram depicting content category relationships.\" attribute and an ARIA role=\"img\" to the object element results in NVDA announcing: graphic, venn diagram depicting content category relationships. The reason for using role=\"img\" is that NVDA does not recognise the object element and does not announce the accessible name (title attribute content) without it. There is a test page so you can try it out for yourself.

I find they have support for feature X, but lack support for feature Y that is required to enable practical support to web content for screen reader users. While it is useful to test and find successful implementations of discrete features, it needs to be viewed in the broader context of which browsers can be considered usable with popular OS level screen readers. I found it difficult to get a complete understanding from the resources available on the web, but have put together a high level support table based on information I could glean. If you have any further information or find any inaccuracies please comment. Practical support Practical support for screen readers means that a browser can be successfully used to browse and interact with commonly encountered web content, using current versions of OS level screen readers such as, on Windows; JAWS, NVDA, Narrator. Talkback on Android. On Mac OS and iOS; VoiceOver. On Linux; Orca and on Chrome OS; ChromeVox. Table legend   “supported” means that the browser is usable in practice with a screen reader on the operating system (OS). Note: in the case of Internet Explorer it lacks support for some important features, but due to its market share screen readers hack around its lack of support.  “partial support” lacks support for some important features.  “not applicable” means the browser does not run on the OS  “not supported” means the browser does not have practical support for screen readers on the OS.  “not known” means that accessibility support information is not publicly available.  not known, but likely is unsupported.  Note: The table refers to the current (23/06/2017) versions of browsers and current versions of operating systems.

The grouping and labelling of thematically related controls within a form is an important aspect of providing semantic information so users can understand and complete a form successfully. Differences in quality and implementation of support across user agents can hamper some users’ ability to benefit from this information. This must not be taken as disincentive to developers, as the benefits of using these elements outweighs the negatives. But it is clear that some assistive technology vendors need to improve implementation of HTML features that enhance accessibility, so their users can gain the most benefit. Using the fieldset and legend elements The HTML 4.1 specification provides a method for grouping and labeling related form controls. This capability is provided by the use of the fieldset and legend elements: The fieldset element allows authors to group thematically related controls and labels. Grouping controls makes it easier for users to understand their purpose while simultaneously facilitating tabbing navigation for visual user agents and speech navigation for speech-oriented user agents. The proper use of this element makes documents more accessible. The legend element allows authors to assign a caption to a fieldset. The legend improves accessibility when the fieldset is rendered non-visually. Whenever a label is needed to provide information about a related set of controls consider using the legend and fieldset elements. They can be used to group any thematically related controls in a form such as address details, date of birth and sets of radio buttons or check boxes. Note: It is required that the fieldset and legend are used in conjunction. A fieldset cannot be used without a legend and visa versa. Example code: <fieldset> <legend>filter by</legend> <input type=\"radio\" name=\"filter\" id=\"a\"> <label for=\"a\">television</label> <input type=\"radio\" name=\"filter\" id=\"b\"> <label for=\"b\">radio</label> <input type=\"radio\" name=\"filter\" id=\"c\"> <label for=\"c\">cinema</label> </fieldset> Presentation to users Visual browsers The default rendering of the fieldset and legend elements is fairly uniform across the major visual browsers. The fieldset is displayed with a solid border and the legend text is overlaid on the top left border. This provides a clear visual indication of the controls that are contained within the group and the caption (legend) that applies to the grouped controls. Default visual display in Internet Explorer, Firefox and Opera      Screen Readers For visual users, the association can be represented by the position of the legend and the enclosing of related controls within a bordered box. How should non visual user agents such as screen readers convey the structural associations provided by the legend and fieldset elements? The most important relationship is that of the legend text to the individual controls contained in a fieldset, as the legend serves to describe the context of the data or choices required. As the content is accessed linearly by screen readers, the apparent simple visual association is not so easily or clearly expressed. The UAAG 1.0 (User Agent Accessibility Guidelines) provide this advice on implementation: HTML 4 specifies the FIELDSET element , which allows authors to group thematically related elements and labels. The LEGEND element assigns a caption to a FIELDSET. For example, the LEGEND element might identify a FIELDSET of radio buttons as “Connection Rate.” Each button could have a LABEL element, stating a rate. When it receives content focus, identify the radio button as “Connection Rate: Radio button X of Y: 28.8kpbs”, where “Y” represents the total number of radio buttons in the grouping and “28.8kbps” is the information contained in the LABEL. With this implementation advice in mind, 2 of the major screen readers were tested using an example fieldset containing 3 radio buttons labelled “television, radio, cinema” with a legend of “filter by”. It was found that what is announced varies depending on the software, mode and navigation keys used. JAWS In Virtual PC cursor and Forms mode the legend is announced when each of the controls contained in a fieldset receive focus. virtual PC cursor ‘browse’ mode If the user moves through the content using a “Say All” (ins+down arrow) command or “Say Next Line” command (down arrow), the legend is announced when intitally encountered, but no indication of association to related controls is provided: filter by radio button televsion, radio button radio, radio button cinema If the “Move To Next Form Field” (F) command (only available in ‘browse’ mode) is used to move through radio buttons within the fieldset the result is different: filter by radio button television, filter by radio button radio, filter by radio button cinema Forms mode The results for navigating through controls contained within the fieldset are the same as when the “Move To Next Form Field” command is used, the legend text is prefixed to each control label contained within the fieldset. Window Eyes Using the default settings no indication of the fieldset or legend is announced in any mode. For the user to be made aware of the presence of a fieldset, the user must first modify the Window Eyes browse mode verbosity settings fieldset option: Insert Beginning / End Message (Fieldsets) This option will notify the user of both the beginning and end of a fieldset element. Browse mode – announce fieldset option enabled When this option is enabled, if the user navigates using the down arrow, the start and end of the fieldset is announced as is the legend text: filter by fieldset start radio button television, radio button radio, radio button cinema filter by fieldset end The user can also navigate using the “Next Fieldset” (E) and “Previous Fieldset” (shift+E) commands. When these commands are used, the end of a fieldset is not announced. If the “Next Control” (C), “Previous Control” (shift+C) or the TAB key is used to navigate, fieldsets and legends are not announced. Using Firefox When using Firefox, Window Eyes does not recognize or announce the presence of the fieldset or legend elements. So for example, when using the “Next Fieldset” (E) command “no fieldset” is announced. Browse mode off (forms mode) When the user is not in browse mode (has to be disabled to for the user to interact with edit boxes, text areas and dropdown lists) the user is confined to navigating through controls using the TAB key and no fieldset or legend information is announced. Testing Notes:  JAWS 8 and Window Eyes 5.5 were used for testing. The fieldset test page was viewed in Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2 on Windows XP. The examples of screen reader output have been edited to include only pertinent announcements.  Conclusion The fieldset and legend elements are a useful part of a web developer’s toolkit for making forms more accessible to people with disabilities. The support in Window Eyes is quite different from the advice given in UAAG1.0. Due to this, Window Eyes users will not be able to gain the full benefit of the additional information provided through the use of these elements. In fact no legend text will be announced to users unless they first enable an option to announce such information. Even when the option is enabled Window Eyes users will not receive this important information when they are inputting data into form fields. Furthermore if they use Window Eyes in conjunction with the Firefox browser no legend or fieldset information will be provided. The situation for JAWS users is much better. The JAWS implementation is consistent with the advice in UAAG 1.0. The grouping of controls using the fieldset is not explicitly announced (as it is in Window Eyes), but the announcing of the fieldset is not advised in UAAG and may be of limited value or overly obtrusive for the users, which could be why it is not enabled by default in Window Eyes. Importantly the association of legend text with controls contained within a fieldset is reliably conveyed by the announcement of the legend along with a control’s text label. This behaviour works when the user is browsing or interacting with form fields and across supported browsers. Due to the nature of the advice in UAAG 1.0 and its implementation in JAWS (legend text being announced before a control’s label text), developers should be mindful of the length of legend texts, as lengthy legend texts have been found to make forms difficult to use. Another potential pot hole is the JAWS behaviour when headings are included within a fieldset. In this case JAWS will typically use the heading text in place of the legend text, this is a quirk or bug, which can lead to unexpected and problematic consequences. This needs to be fixed in JAWS, but until it is, perhaps the use of headings within fieldsets should be minimised. The fieldset and legend elements are well supported by many user agents. While it is helpful to have knowledge of some of the quirks and failings of particular user agents, the poor support in software such as Window Eyes must not stop developers using these elements or accessibility practitioners recommending their use. Their use can make it easier for a wide range of disabled users to fill out forms. In order to improve accessibility for all disabled users, web standards must be adhered to so that developers can code for accessibility with confidence. It is the assistive technology vendor’s job in these cases to fix their implementations.    INSERT key usage in Windows on a Mac  Posted on Thursday, 22 August 2013 by Matthew Atkinson  Category: Strategy   This article collects together and updates advice I have encountered on and off the web to access or map the INSERT key in Windows on a Mac (either in a Virtual Machine or via Boot Camp), which is useful when you are using assistive technologies such as screen readers. The problem You may want to use keystrokes in screen readers such as INSERT+F7 (in NVDA or JAWS) to bring up a list of links on the page, or INSERT+CTRL+; (in JAWS) to bring up a list of ARIA landmark regions. However:  Mac laptops do not have the INSERT key. CAPS LOCK cannot be easily used as a replacement, due to the different (to Windows) way that Mac keyboards handle it.  If you have an Apple keyboard with numeric keypad Then the “0” key on the numeric keypad is INSERT in Windows. Thanks to Hans Hillen for pointing this out. If you wish, you can also map other keys (such as the relatively unused F16) to INSERT, too (more details below). If you have a Mac laptop, or non-numeric keyboard In this case, you have three options, detailed below. Use your Virtual Machine to map a key (or combination) to INSERT If you are running Windows in a Virtual Machine on OS X, the VM application will most likely offer a key-mapping facility.  Instructions for VMWare Fusion 5 Instructions for Parallels Desktop 7 VirtualBox passes all keys except the Host Key directly to the Virtual Machine, so you would need to use a key remapping program within Windows.  Use a key remapping program within Windows There are a number of utilities that can be used to achieve this, including the following.  SharpKeys The Windows “Remapkey” tool mentioned in this WebAIM article  Use the numpad on the Mac laptop keyboard Mac laptops have a ‘hidden’ numeric keypad, as discussed in the WebAIM article mentioned above, though due to the extra keystrokes required to access it, this approach is not recommended.  On joining the HTML editors team  Posted on Sunday, 10 February 2013 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy    I am honoured and excited to say I am now a member of the W3C HTML editors team. Joining Robin, Erika, Silvia, Ted and Travis to work on continuing the development of HTML.  What does this mean? In practical terms it means I have write access to the HTML specification on Github. This does not mean I, or any of the editors, can change HTML at will. It does mean I have a little more opportunity to effect change upon the development of the HTML language in accordance with the agreed upon processes of the HTML Working Group. It primarily means a bucketload of work in the form of responding to and resolving bugs. Recent discussions and changes:  Discussion which lead to a minor change in the information in the HTML spec about using the figure element. Discussion which lead to some minor changes in the information in the HTML spec about using main element. Resolved a bug which resulted in the addition of a section about Captcha Images to HTML 5.1  Note: all of the above changes are preliminary changes to the HTML 5.1 editor’s draft and subject to change based on feedback and future decisions of the HTML working group. Working together The development of the HTML standard is a collaborative effort and it is important that the voices of users and developers, as well as implementers, are heard and taken into account. You can provide input in a number of ways:  Join the HTML Working Group Comment via the HTML Public comments list File a bug on the HTML spec (requires registering for a bugzilla account – its simple!) Dropping into #HTML-WG IRC and chatting, it’s logged.  I  also follow discussions on blogs such as HTML5Doctor.com and bring up HTML related discussions to the working group’s attention. You can keep up with changes to the spec on twitter via @HTML_commits.

How does the semantic meaning of the mark element translate to informing users who cannot see the highlight? Currently it does not, as the accessibility layer implementation across browsers is incomplete, and in browsers where it is supported the assistive technology support is not present.  CSS to fill the gap One possible method that could be used to provide an indication of the presence of marked text is to use the CSS :before and :after pseudo elements. Text indicating the start and end of the marked text is added and then hidden off screen (but still announced by screen readers). Code example HTML <p>\\r   <mark>This text</mark>\\r   is marked as highlighted.\\r </p> CSS mark::before, mark::after {\\r   content:\" [highlight start] \";\\r   clip-path: inset(100%);\\r   clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\\r   height: 1px;\\r   width: 1px;\\r   overflow: hidden;\\r   position: absolute;\\r   white-space: nowrap;\\r }\\r \\r mark::after {\\r   content:\" [highlight end] \";\\r } See the Pen Using CSS to provide missing semantics for the mark element by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.  Advantages and disadvantages    It’s simple to implement It works well with modern screen readers and evergreen browsers it could also be used for other text level elements whose semantics are not exposed aurally, but it would be useful to do so; ins and del for example. This method does not work in IE11 It blurs the line between CSS for presentation and HTML for content It could be overused and become an irritant rather than informative    Addendum  You can also make <mark> work better in Windows High Contrast Mode by leaning on system colors: https://t.co/uCBJ071ayp — Adrian Roselli 🗯 (@aardrian) December 5, 2017   Google Chrome Screen Reader Support update  Posted on Monday, 21 June 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Refer to Google Chrome accessibility update  Following last weeks post about Google Chrome accessibility which was prompted by The Google Chrome Screen Reader Accessibility Petition created by Alex Hiironen, new information about Google Chrome screen reader support has been added to the Google Chrome (Chromium) wiki:  Supported Screen Readers The latest versions of these screen readers have partial support for Chrome now:  System Access to Go (Windows) VoiceOver (Mac OS X)  These screen readers do not yet recognize Chrome’s non-focusable web content (links, form fields and other focusable content is spoken as expected), so you will be unable to enter “browse mode”:  JAWS (Windows) Window-Eyes (Windows) NVDA (Windows)  We hope to work with all screen reader developers to resolve any issues so that they can enable full support for Chrome. The list above is not a comprehensive list of all screen readers, but in the interest of prioritizing support for the greatest number of users, we believe that supporting the screen readers above will have the greatest impact. If external developers are interested in helping to add support for additional screen readers, we would welcome the help. For more detailed information about the technical design and current status, see the Accessibility Design Document.   Emulating failure  Posted on Monday, 2 February 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   HTML has a problem. As implemented in browsers many interactive elements cannot be styled as desired by web developers, or developers as directed by designers, marketing or any of the numerous others whose wishes code cutters must abide by.  Something borrowed, something blue Take for example, Google’s gmail UI, a ‘web application’ if there ever was one. It consists of literally 100’s of controls, many of which are simple controls such as buttons and checkboxes.  Looking under the hood, what is evident is there are a lot of custom controls built from <div>‘s and <span>‘s: HTML: 1, HEAD: 1, STYLE: 8, META: 6, TITLE: 1, LINK: 3, SCRIPT: 11, BODY: 1,  IFRAME: 11,  DIV: 3757, FORM: 3,  INPUT: 11,  NOSCRIPT: 1,  P: 1,  A: 107,  B: 433, OL: 1, LI: 19, BR: 115, UL: 2, SPAN: 1603,  IMG: 263,  H2: 6,  FIELDSET: 2,  LEGEND: 2,  TABLE: 10, TBODY: 61, TR: 284, TD: 1618, BUTTON: 1, H1: 1, NOBR: 1, H3: 6, HR: 1, COLGROUP: 5, COL: 34, TEXTAREA: 1. Digging a little deeper: There are 1172 instances of the role attribute, including:  304 – role=\"checkbox\" 83 – role=\"button\" 54 – role=\"option\"  These roles are some examples of  native elements of HTML that in 2015 continue to be re-invented using <div>‘s and <span>‘s, but have been around since pretty much the dawn of HTML. The <button> and <input type=\"button\"> elements are latecomers as they first appeared in HTML 4 in 1999, while <input type=\"checkbox\"> and <option> appeared in HTML 2 in 1995. Now in 2015 we have web components re-inventing native HTML buttons, radio buttons and checkboxes, for relief from the scourge of divitis, perpetrated upon us by the as shipped inability to style a native HTML element as desired. Is it just me, or are new web UI technologies continuing to try to solve the wrong problems?

Again.   Short note on use of alt=”” and the title attribute  Posted on Wednesday, 10 February 2016 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: StandardsCategory: Testing   A discussion occured on A11ySlackers gitter channel last evening about whether use of the following markup pattern was a WCAG 2.0 failure: <img src=\"a.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"some text\">  The Important Question The more important question is this – does this markup pattern result in the desired outcome? i.e. is the title attribute content conveyed to users? From adhoc testing (test page) with Firefox, Safari, IE, Chrome, Edge, Window Eyes, JAWS, Narrator and VoiceOver, it was found that neither of the following work reliably across browser and screen reader combinations. non empty title with empty alt <img src=\"a.gif\" alt=\"\" title=\"some text\"> or this pattern: non empty title with no alt <img src=\"a.gif\" title=\"some text\"> There a number of reasons for this:  alt=\"\" is a standardised indication to screen reader software that the <img> is decorative and can be safely ignored. Testing by Powermapper from 2015: IMG with null ALT and non-null TITLE attributes  found issues with alt=\"\" + non-empty title. Absence of an alt attribute results, in some screen reading screen reader software, not conveying the <img> to users.  Note: Found this issue with JAWS 17 and Chrome 48 on Windows 10. Testing by Powermapper from 2015: IMG with TITLE Screen reader compatibility found no issues with this pattern.   Some browsers implement the HTML5 requirement that alt=\"\" is equal to role=\"presentation\" which results in the <img> being removed from the accessibility tree, so despite there being a non empty title, the <img> is hidden.  Notes: Absence of an alt attribute on the <img> element is non conforming in HTML5, except under very limited circumstances, although it is not considered a WCAG 2.0 failure. Refer to a Short note on alt in HTML. Use of the title attribute is known to be an unreliable method to visually convey information to users. Refer to Using the HTML title attribute. This is part of the reason why the use of the title attribute to provide a text alternative for an image was deemed non conforming in HTML5. Some history.    HTML5 Accessibility Chops: Block Links  Posted on Friday, 17 June 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   It is conforming in HTML5 for links to include block level elements such as headings and paragraphs, this was forbidden in previous versions of HTML. A recent article by @feather concludes that the inclusion of block level elements inside a link causes some Assistive Technology (AT) to misbehave. Block Links in HTML5 The HTML5 specification says: The a element may be wrapped around entire paragraphs, lists, tables, and so forth, even entire sections, so long as there is no interactive content within (e.g. buttons or other links). Reading the article prompted me to dig a bit deeper into the issues: HTML5 block link tests Summary of results I created some test cases to tease out the different behaviours I was finding from testing permuations of the example in @feather’s article.  JAWS, NVDA and Window Eyes all treat text in a link that is contained both inside and outside of a block level element as separate links when the user navigates through the content using the cursor keys.  <a href=\"#\"><p>link one</p> link 2 </a>   Jaws skips link content outside of the block level element when a user navigates using the link shortcuts keys (in Internet Explorer only).  <a href=\"#\"><p>link one</p> link 2 </a>   NVDA announces ‘link’ for each line of text content in a link containing line breaks.  VoiceOver has bugs that cause it to repeat link text in a number of situations, 2 of which are unrelated to the change in conforming use of the a element in HTML5:  a link includes a text within block level element and text in the link.  <a href=\"#\"><p>paragraph element</p> and some text</a>   a link includes both text and an image with a non empty alt attribute.  <a href=\"#\">link text and <img src=\"tick.png\" alt=\"image\"></a>   a link includes a line break.  <a href=\"#\">some text before a line brake <br> and some more text after.</a>    Note: Also found that in Firefox, the default underline style for links is removed for text content inside a block level element contained in a link. Conclusion A link should contain a brief description of the link target, the possibility of links containing paragraphs of text is a potential issue that requires users to speak up about. Main advice is to include the key information at the start of a link. The current behaviour in the Windows screen readers does not appear problematic or broken.  The VoiceOver issues are not due to inclusion of block level elements per se, but a symptom of a more general bug that needs to be fixed.  Using the tabindex attribute  Posted on Monday, 4 August 2014 by Léonie Watson  Category: Strategy   The HTML tabindex attribute is used to manage keyboard focus. Used wisely, it can effectively handle focus within web widgets. Used unwisely however, the tabindex attribute can destroy the usability of web content for keyboard users.  The tabindex attribute indicates that an element can be focused on, and determines how that focus is handled. It takes an integer (whole number) as a value, and the resulting keyboard interaction varies depending on whether the integer is positive, negative or 0. To understand why the tabindex attribute has such a powerful effect on usability, it’s necessary to know something of the way keyboard interaction works. A keyboard user will typically move through web content using the tab key, moving from one focusable element to the next in sequential order. Certain interactive HTML elements like links and form controls are focusable by default. When they’re included in a web page, their sequential order is determined by the source order of the HTML.  <label for=\"username\">Username:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\">  <label for=\"password\">Password:</label> <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\">  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Log in\">  A keyboard user would tab first to the username field, then the password field, and finally to the log in button. All three elements take focus by default, and they’re accessed in the order that they appear in the source code. In other words, there’s no need to explicitly set the tabindex because it’s all handled effortlessly in the browser. tabindex=0 When tabindex is set to 0, the element is inserted into the tab order based on its location in the source code. If the element is focusable by default there’s no need to use tabindex at all, but if you’re repurposing an element like a <span> or <div>, then tabindex=0 is the natural way to include it in the tab order. It’s worth mentioning at this point that it’s easier to use a focusable HTML element wherever possible. For example, when you choose to use a <button> or <input type=\"checkbox\">, keyboard focus and keyboard interaction are handled automatically by the browser. When you repurpose other elements to create custom widgets, you’ll need to provide keyboard focus and interaction support manually. tabindex=-1 When tabindex is set to a negative integer like -1, it becomes programmatically focusable but it isn’t included in the tab order. In other words, it can’t be reached by someone using the tab key to navigate through content, but it can be focused on with scripting. An example is moving focus to a summary of errors returned by a form. The summary would typically be located at the start of the form, so you want to draw the attention of screen reader/magnifier users to it, and to position all keyboard-only users at the start of the form so they can begin correcting any errors. You don’t want the error summary itself to be included in the tab order of the page though.  <div role=\"group\" id=\"errorSummary\" aria-labelledby=\"errorSummaryHeading\" tabindex=\"-1\"> <h2 id=\"errorSummaryHeading\">Your information contains three errors</h2> <ul> ... </ul> </div>  tabindex=1+ It’s when tabindex is set to a positive integer that things get problematic. It imposes a tab order on the content that bears no resemblance to the expected tab order.  <label for=\"username\">Username:</label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" tabindex=\"3\">  <label for=\"password\">Password:</label> <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" tabindex=\"1\">  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Log in\" tabindex=\"2\">  In this example the visual presentation of the form would be as expected: Username and password fields, followed by the log in button. The tab order would make no sense at all however. Focus would move first to the password field, then the log in button, and finally to the username field. Things get worse when you realise that the password field would be the first focusable element on the page containing the form. It doesn’t matter how many focusable elements appear in the source order/visual presentation before the password field, the tabindex of 1 means it’ll be the first element to receive focus on the page. The tabindex attribute is versatile, and it has the capacity to improve or destroy usability for keyboard-only users. When you think about using the tabindex attribute, keep these things in mind:  Use tabindex=0 to include an element in the natural tab order of the content, but remember that an element that is focusable by default may be an easier option than a custom control Use tabindex=-1 to give an element programmatic focus, but exclude it from the tab order of the content Avoid using tabindex=1+.

This has accessibility ramifications.  Testing the Flipboard site on a mobile device such as an iPhone, quickly reveals that the content is not available to screen reader users. This is because the content is painted onto a canvas element using React Canvas. The words, structure and UI are all visual, there is nothing but pixels. Reading the React Canvas documentation. It states: Accessibility This area needs further exploration. Using fallback content (the canvas DOM sub-tree) should allow screen readers such as VoiceOver to interact with the content. We’ve seen mixed results with the iOS devices we’ve tested. I put together a very simple example of what Flipboard could do to make the content trapped in the canvas pixels available to other users:  Structured text and interactive content within the canvas sub DOM <canvas id=\"myCanvas\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\"> <header> <p>From the daily edition.</p> <h2> <a id=\"theLink\"  href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/why-well-miss-jon-stewart-on-the-daily-show\"  target=\"_blank\"> 19 Reasons We’ll Miss Jon Stewart On “The Daily Show”</a> </h2> </header> <p>buzzfeed - Jarett Wieselman</p> <p>We’ll need a million Moments of Zen to emotionally endure this loss.

The test file only includes one event handler on the canvas that activates the link in the canvas sub DOM (to keep it simple for demo purposes and also because its the limit of my canvas scripting abilities.) It is presumed that since all the data that is written to the canvas is available it should not be onerous to include it in the canvas sub DOM and this could occur after the canvas has been painted, so as not to effect the performance benefits.

The short answer for the two main screen readers JAWS and Window Eyes is no. Neither do they support i or b for that matter. What is meant here by support is, do they using default settings provide an indication to the user by changing voice or some other method when text content is marked up using these elements, or do they have the option to provide an indication in their HTML specific settings. UPDATE 28/01/10 A tweet by Dan Clark points out that JAWS has a document proofreading scheme called Proofreading (attributes), using this scheme italicized, stricken and bolded text is indicated by a change in voice, but there is no distinction between <em> or <i> and <strong> or <b>. He also mentions that JAWS schemes can be accessed via a dialog using the INS+ALT+S key combination. Testing Support for strong and other elements A simple test document was used containing example uses of the strong, em, i, b, strike, and del HTML 4 elements. Window Eyes 5.5 and JAWS 8.0 were used to read the test document in Internet Explorer 7. Results: Using the default settings, neither screen reader indicated the presence of any of the elements tested.    element JAWS Window Eyes   strong no indication no indication   b no indication no indication   em no indication no indication   i no indication no indication   del no indication no indication   strike no indication no indication    JAWS schemes and Window Eyes attribute settings JAWS and Window Eyes have control panels that allow users to modify how various aspects of web pages are announced. For JAWS it is the HTML Options dialog which can be reached via ‘Utilities > Configuration Manager > Set Options’ . It provides no settings for the strong or em elements or any of the elements tested. Window Eyes has the ‘browse mode’ dialog accessed from the ‘Verbosity Options’ menu, again no settings for the strong or em elements or any of the elements tested. JAWS has a general text reading feature called ‘Schemes’, that allows users to change what and how information about interface elements and text formatting is conveyed in all applications . It can be found in the ‘Speech and Sounds manager’ dialog. Different schemes can be chosen that provide extra information to the user that is not provided in the ‘Classic’ (default) scheme. Unfortunately none of the pre-configured choices provide for providing indications of bolded or italicised text alone, they also include indications of text size, font type etc. I imagine that having all this extra information provided would quickly become tiresome for the user. It appears such schemes are intended for specific tasks such as proof reading. Refer to update at start of article. Window Eyes has similar functionality to provide indication of color,style,font and size, called ‘Attribute Changes’. It is an item on the ‘screen’ menu. It does not appear to work on web pages using the keyboard to access content, but moving the mouse over bolded and italicised words on a web page does result in the format change being announced. Conclusion Using the semantic elements strong and em does not convey any useful information to users of JAWS or Window Eyes under typical browsing conditions. While it is good to know this, it is not a reason to not use these elements to convey meaning. Accessibility is not just about people with vision impairment, it’s about all user’s with disabilites, and web standards is not just about accessibility. This is merely another example where screen reader vendors are not serving their customers well. As these tests only cover 2 of the screen readers available, it would be interesting to know if other products exhibit the same lack of support. so please test with your favourite screen reader and leave a comment with the results.  Shut up JAWS  Posted on Tuesday, 4 July 2017 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development   One of the tasks I perform regularly is to test web content using screen readers. It can be somewhat annoying to be capturing data in a desktop application while testing in a browser, as the screen reader is chattering away on every application, while I am only interested in how it works with web content in the browser. I realize that this is something that I should have learned to do many years ago, but didn’t, it took some guidance from my new boss Matt Ater:  Putting JAWS to Sleep in ALL Apps Except Browsers  Open default.jcf in your favourite text editor (default.jcf can be found at: C:\\\\Users\\\\’LoginID‘\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Freedom Scientific\\\\JAWS\\\\18.0\\\\Settings\\\\enu)   Add SleepMode=1 under [options], then save and close.   Select, then press enter or Double click on the Default.jcf file, this will open the settings center dialog From the application dropdown select a browser e.g. Firefox   In the treeview, open the miscellaneous branch and select disable from the sleepmode combobox   Press apply button Do the same for the other browsers and any other applications you want JAWS to be awake for. That’s it, you are done. Now JAWS will be silent unless you have one of the applications you have enabled, open.  Now to find out how to do the same in VoiceOver, NVDA and ChromeVox etc… ',\n",
       " 1: ' Notes on Web Components + ARIA  Posted on Friday, 6 July 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   After listening to the Google IO  web components presentation I decided to take another look at this emerging web technology. It sort of struck me as a client side version of server side includes. Anyway I was interested in testing out an experimental implementation of web components in Chrome and to see how it plays with ARIA.  what are web components? I am making no attempt at explaining what it is, as I would probably make a hash of it, but here is how web components is described in the Introduction to Web Components document: The component model for the Web (also known as Web Components) consists  of four pieces designed to be used together to let web application  authors define widgets with a level of visual richness not possible with  CSS alone, and ease of composition and reuse not possible with script  libraries today. How does use of the shadow DOM content affect ARIA use? A potential sticking point about web components from an accessibility standpoint is that the HTML inserted into a document using web components is included in the Shadow DOM not the regular HTML DOM. I wanted to check how this affects the use of ARIA roles, states and properties. Initial findings Results from initial testing indicate that inclusion of ARIA roles, states and properties in content wholly inside the Shadow DOM works fine. The accessibility information is exposed correctly via the accessibility API. Screen readers can access content in the Shadow DOM without issue. There is a problem however if ARIA relationship attributes such as aria-labelledby are used on content in the regular DOM that references content in the Shadow DOM or, used on content in the shadow DOM that references content in the regular DOM. So if an input is in the shadow DOM: <input type=\"text\" aria-labelledby=\"light\"> references an element  in the regular DOM <span id=\"light\">regular label for text box in shadow</span> The expected result i.e. the accessible name for the input  is the text content of the referenced element, does not happen. The labelledby relationship is broken. Detailed tests and results page Notes: These are only initial tests and findings based on my limited understanding of web components and experimental implementations. To only view the results any browser will do To test, or view content in the shadow DOM you will need:  Chrome with the shadow DOM experimental feature enabled. To enable, put chrome://flags in the address bar and open the flags page. Enable the “Shadow DOM. Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS This API allows web applications to use Web Components.” flag. Also useful to enable “Developer Tools experiments. Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS Enable Developer Tools experiments. Use Settings panel in Developer Tools to toggle individual experiments.” flag so you can see Shadow DOM content in the developer tools. Note you have to check “show shadow DOM” in the developer tools setting as well. an accessibility information inspection tool such as aViewer  Further Reading on Web Components  Introduction to Web Components Shadow DOM spec HTML Templates spec Web Components on Google+   WAI-ARIA Implementation in JavaScript UI Libraries – updated  Posted on Monday, 13 July 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIA   A number of popular Javascript UI Libraries are in the process of adding WAI-ARIA support to their widgets and components.

Testing WAI-ARIA Role Support  Posted on Thursday, 4 December 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: ARIA   For WAI-ARIA to be useful, to people with disabilities who use assistive technology, access to the information that ARIA roles and properties provides must be well supported across a range of browsers and assistive technologies. One of the activities going on over at codetalks is the development and testing of ARIA test cases. As part of this effort, I have been developing simple test cases for ARIA role support and testing them using the Firefox browser and a range of commonly used assistive software.  ARIA Roles ARIA Roles are categorized as follows:  Taxonomy Roles User Input Controls User Interface Elements Document Structure Specialized Regions  The taxonomy roles do not require implementaion testing as they are abstract definitions and not used in content. To understand how and if the other roles are correctly supported by browsers and assistive technology they need to be tested.

Feedback/comments welcome!  The current state of modal dialog accessibility  Posted on Friday, 29 June 2018 by Scott O\\'Hara  Category: Development   Modal dialogs continue to be troublesome UI components all across the web. Putting aside the fact they are often misused and thrust on users in a manner that interrupts their current task (asking me to sign up for your newsletter, while I’m in the middle of reading an article, is not cool), even appropriately used modals often lack considerations for accessibility. While poor modal dialog UX is still common, that’s not to say there haven’t been strides to make these experiences better. Performing a search for “accessible modal dialog”, you’ll find many developers (myself included) have been writing about and releasing production-ready custom dialog scripts, and awareness of the dialog element has been growing. But to truly get a handle on the current state of modal dialog accessibility, one should be aware of the current issues facing both native and custom (ARIA) modal dialogs. The native dialog element, what’s the hold up? I mentioned the dialog element in an article I wrote for Smashing Magazine (2014), as well as in my follow-up post about my modal dialog script (2016). At the time of writing those articles, dialog had been at least partially implemented into Chrome and Firefox behind a flag. It’s been almost 4 years now (5ish if you go back to the earliest implementation of the dialog element in Chrome Canary), but adoption of the element is still lacking. As for a quick rundown of the different browsers:  Chrome 37+ and other blink-based browsers support the dialog element (for instance: Opera 24+, Opera Mobile 46, Android/Chrome Android 67). Firefox (53+) still requires the dialog to be manually enabled. Safari (macOs and iOS) do not presently support dialog and have a request for inclusion dating back to 2012 Microsoft Edge has it marked as “under consideration”. Finally, Internet Explorer, will never support dialog.  While browser implementation hasn’t budged much in the last few years, there has been some interesting progress with ARIA and additional methods to create better experiences for custom modal dialogs. A brief recap of expected modal dialog behavior  But before getting into some of the newer bits, let’s do a quick recap on what should be expected for an accessible modal dialog.  When a modal dialog is activated, focus must be moved to the dialog. Where focus is initially placed may vary depending on the dialog’s content, but focusing the dialog itself can provide a consistently predictable user experience. A modal dialog should have an accessible name, announce itself as a dialog, and should provide standard methods for the user to close it. e.g. by a close button, by use of esc key, mouse clicking or tapping outside of the dialog, and ensuring F6 will continue to allow the user to move keyboard focus to the browser’s address bar. While the modal dialog is active, the contents obscured by the modal dialog should be inaccessible to all users. This means that the TAB key, and a screen reader’s virtual cursor (arrow keys) should not be allowed to leave the modal dialog and traverse the content outside of the dialog. When a modal dialog is closed, focus should return to the control that initially activated the dialog. This will allow keyboard and screen reader users to continue to parse the document from where they left off. If a modal dialog was not initiated by a purposeful user action (boo), or the element that had activated the dialog is no longer in the DOM, then closing the dialog should place the user’s focus in a logical location. e.g. if a dialog was opened on page load, then focus could be placed on either the body or main element. If the trigger was removed from the DOM, then placing focus as close to the trigger’s DOM location would be ideal.  OK, now that that’s squared away, let’s get back to the new hotness… Updates to ARIA and using inert Since the release of my previous script, the aria-modal attribute has been introduced, and allowing “dialog” as a value for aria-haspopup have been added to ARIA 1.1. These additions would be a huge help with making modal dialogs more accessible, if not for the following implementation bumps: aria-modal aria-modal is meant to indicate to screen readers that only content contained within a dialog with aria-modal=\"true\" should be accessible to the user. This attribute is a pretty big deal and a very welcome addition to the specification. The aria-modal attribute will help in taking care of one of the biggest hurdles with custom modal dialogs; keeping a screen reader within the active dialog, as creating a JavaScript trap for standard keyboard focus is not enough to curtail a wandering virtual cursor. Testing across different screen reader and browser pairings, this attribute largely performs as expected when the value is set to true, with one unfortunate exception. Safari + VoiceOver on both macOS and iOS have issues with it making static content within a modal dialog inaccessible (see logged WebKit bug). Additionally, aria-modal=\"false\" does not work as expected in some browser and screen reader pairings. This issue is far less severe as one could simply just not use aria-modal=\"false\", as being set to false should convey the same information as if the attribute wasn’t present at all. aria-haspopup At the time of writing this, most screen readers do not yet support aria-haspopup=\"dialog\". Often they will make no mention of a control’s association with a dialog, and some will fallback to announcing the control as opening a menu (as haspopup‘s origins were associated with menus), which would lead to quite an unexpected experience for users. Until support for the dialog value has better implementation, it’s probably best to not use aria-haspopup on the element that opens the modal dialog. In the meantime, one could add some sort of visual and/or visually hidden indicator (icon and/or text) to inform users that a modal dialog will open. inert paired with aria-hidden=\"true\" Where aria-modal still has some kinks to work out with WebKit, improved inert polyfill support (Google inert or WICG inert) can be paired with aria-hidden=\"true\" on elements outside of a modal dialog to ensure that keyboard focus and screen reader virtual cursors will be less likely to interact with the content obscured by an active modal dialog. For instance, a user should be able to leave the current document to access the browser’s chrome (e.g. via use of the F6 key to move focus to the browser’s address bar). When this user attempts to re-enter the document, inert and aria-hidden=\"true\" will prevent their focus from landing on elements obscured by the modal dialog, and ensure the only place for the user’s focus to go, would be to the contents of the dialog. Adding aria-hidden=\"true\" to elements outside of the active modal dialog ensures that elements not within the active modal dialog will not be surfaced if a user opens a screen reader’s list of elements (headings, form controls, landmarks, etc.) in the document. This would be something that aria-modal=\"true\" would take care of, pending its current issues with VoiceOver get resolved. Finally, the use of aria-hidden=\"true\" and inert together negate the ability for VoiceOver users to escape a modal dialog when reading line by line (by use of Up and Down arrow keys, without the VO modifier key). Most custom modal dialogs I’ve seen in the wild do not account for this sort navigation. Additional Gotchas to watch out for Beyond the above mentioned issues with aria-modal and aria-haspopup=\"dialog\", there are a few other things I’ve uncovered in my testing of modal dialogs that should be noted: Do not set dialogs to display: none by default. There is an issue with iOS Safari + VoiceOver where if an element is initially set to display: none;, even when updated to display: block; VoiceOver will not move focus to the element, even if focus is programmatically set. I’ve found to get around this bug, the CSS for dialogs should instead use visibility: hidden; for their inactive state, and visibility: visible;when they are displayed. Since a dialog should be set to position: fixed; or in some situations absolute, the common side effect of visibility: hidden elements still taking up physical space in the DOM order, will be averted. Additionally useful, having a modal dialog set to visibility: hidden rather than display: none means it will be possible to utilize CSS transitions. If using the hidden attribute to hide dialogs in their default state (which will ensure that if CSS is ever blocked, the dialogs won’t become visible – useful for a browser’s reader mode), the hidden attribute can have its CSS modified to account for the above mentioned bug:  [role=\"dialog\"][hidden] {\\r   display: block;\\r   visibility: hidden;\\r }  display: block undoes the hidden attribute’s default display: none CSS, while visibility: hidden re-hides the dialog for it’s inactive state. Overly verbose NVDA announcements When testing with NVDA, setting focus to a typically non-focusable element (e.g. a heading with tabindex=\"-1\") can result in NVDA redundantly announcing the focused element and the contents of the dialog multiple times. As placing focus on the first focusable element of a modal dialog can result in inconsistent and even unfavorable starting points for a screen reader user (e.g. if the first focusable element is the close button at the end of a content heavy dialog, or an input at the mid-point of a dialog’s content where content prior to it could be missed) it’s best to just focus the dialog element itself and allow the user to navigate the dialog in sequential order as they would a standard document. IE11 needs the first element of the modal dialog to be its heading The first element of a modal dialog should be its heading (which provides its accessible name). This requirement is to compensate for Internet Explorer 11 + JAWS specifically. With this pairing, setting focus to the dialog element itself will announce the accessible name of the dialog, the dialog role, and then JAWS will re-announce the accessible name of the dialog, and the role of the first child element of the dialog. For instance, if the dialog’s heading provides the accessible name for the dialog, then JAWS + IE11 will announce “heading text, dialog. heading text, heading level #”. However, if the first child is another element that does not match the accessible name of the dialog, such as a button with text “close”, it will be announced as: “heading text, dialog. heading text, button” NVDA will not announce the dialog role when the dialog itself receives focus Testing with NVDA, the dialog role will not be announced when focus is set to the dialog element itself. For instance, in NVDA + IE11, it will simply announce the accessible name of the dialog, and nothing more. In more standard browser pairings like Firefox or Chrome, the accessible name of the dialog will be announced, and then the contents of the dialog will begin to be announced, without ever mentioning the dialog role. Wrapping up Until native dialogs are ubiquitous across all major browsers, we’re going to continue to need ARIA to help us make sure modal dialogs are accessible. But, bear in mind, some ARIA features are also relatively new and also require some time to get full support with both browsers and screen readers. Until either native dialogs or ARIA properties reach full support, it is our responsibility to continue to test not only our modal dialogs, but any component we are building, to ensure it provides (and continues to provide) an accessible user experience. Browsers, screen readers, and even authoring guidelines / specifications may require changes, even breaking ones, over time. Thus it makes sense for us to look at these patterns time and time again, and make sure they still work the way they’ve been outlined and that works best for all users.  ComputerWorld says ‘Safari 4 Tuned to Web Standards…Accessibility…ARIA”  Posted on Friday, 1 January 2010 by Mike Paciello  Category: News   IDG/ComputerWorld’s Tom Yager wrote an interesting review of Safari 4. Among several interesting points concerning WebKit and performance, Yager wrote,  “A fast and pretty browser won’t cut it for me. A browser — and, indeed, any application that incorporates the linkable framework of that browser — must place an equal emphasis on standards promotion and adoption, as well as accessibility. OS X’s integrated Voice Assist and Universal Access preferences stand apart as mechanisms for inclusion for the visual and motor impaired. New to Safari 4 is support for ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications), which takes screen reading and modalities for atypical navigation to the next level, to Web 2.0/AJAX Web apps and sites.” Do yourself a favor and read the rest of the article at:Test Center: Safari 4 preview At TPG, we’ll do a review of Safari 4 for ARIA support and WCAG2 compliance and post it here.  HTML5 accessibility implementation support in browsers  Posted on Wednesday, 18 June 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy    I have been testing and tracking browser accessibility implementation support for a range of new HTML features since 2010. Data can be found on HTML5accessibility.com. Over the last week I also undertook a more formal, targeted testing of the normative implementation requirements in the WAI-ARIA section of the HTML5.0 specification which is currently on its way to becoming a W3C Recommendation.   .@Firefox ? 58 tests  @webkit ? 58 tests  @IE ? 47 tests  @googlechrome ? 40 tests #HTML5 #accessibility requirements http://t.co/2BMdZ08brH — Steve Faulkner (@stevefaulkner) June 17, 2014  Understanding the testing results HTML5 contains normative requirements (things a browser MUST implement) to be considered to support HTML5. In order for HTML5.0 to become a W3C Recommendation the normative requirements must be implemented interoperably (i.e. in at least 2 independent browsers). One of the methods used to decide whether a given HTML feature is implemented interoperably is to create tests and test the assertions in the specification in browsers. Details of the requirements are in the Model CR Exit Criteria (Public Permissive version 3). In the case of accessibility semantics implementation the assertions are framed in terms of ARIA roles, states and properties as implicit ARIA semantics. For example:    HTML feature Implicit ARIA semantics   button element button role    Another step is required ARIA semantics in this case are used as an abstract indicator of the platform specific requirements. To find out and test what browsers are actually required to implement to conform to the above requirement we have to refer to the ARIA implementation guide, which describes the implementation requirements for ARIA semantics in terms of the platform accessibility API mappings    MSAA + UIA Express role (IE on windows) MSAA + IAccessible2 role andother IAccessible2 features (Firefox chrome on windows) ATK/AT-SPI role (firefox on linux) Mac OS XAXRole AXSubrole AXRoleDescription (Safari, Chrome, Firefox on OSX)   PUSHBUTTON PUSHBUTTON PUSH_BUTTON AXButton <nil> ‘button’    So from this information it can be assessed whether a browser passes or fails the assertion that the button element has a button role by looking at what role the browser exposes via the platform accessibility API(s) it has implemented (noted browser/platform in table headers) . We can look at the accessibility information (roles and properties) by using an object inspection tool, such as aViewer inspect.exe or a11y-probe. For example, using aViewer it can be confirmed that Firefox 29 on Windows exposes the correct role for the button element: button element information exposed in MSAA and Iaccessible2 by Firefox 29 is role of button. The results of testing all the assertions within the WAI-ARIA section of the HTML5.0 Last Call Working Draft specification are available: Implementation status for HTML5 element/attribute accessibility mappings Notes The accessibility requirements specified in the HTML5.0/5.1 specifications are only a subset of browser accessibility implementation requirements. Much of what is needed is simply not specified in any HTML specification. Work is continuing on a HTML accessibility mapping and related specifications to fully define the requirements on browsers to support HTML and SVG accessibility. The testing conducted is for the purposes of checking HTML5 Last Call Working Draft specification support, these are a subset of the requirements contained in the (still in development) HTML 5.1 specification,  features that do not have at least 2  implementations  are absent from HTML5.0 (e.g. dialog element).

If Quick Nav is active you can use the w  and W keys  to navigate to the next or previous landmark. When you use  the arrow  keys to navigate around a page, VoiceOver announces when you  enter and  leave landmarks, including the type of landmark (for example  “Leaving  main landmark, entering complementary landmark”). vision australia versions of the Web Accessibility Toolbar and Color Contrast Analyser Worked with my old employers vision australia to make updated versions of the Web Accessibility Toolbar and Color Contrast Analyser available for download on their site. Funky aria-describedby and aria-labelledby support in IE9  Looked into the aria-describedby and aria-labelledbytest cases provided by Todd Kloots, generated some further test cases from his, and found that:  latest versions of NVDA and JAWS used with  IE 9 will not announce descriptions unless tabindex=-1 is added to  elements such as p, div and span when referenced from aria-describedby or aria-labelledby that reference multiple elements:  <input type=\"text\" aria-labelledby=\"label1 label2\"> <input type=\"text\" aria-describedby=\"desc1 desc2\">    As I found previously, aria-describedby with a single reference: <input type=\"text\" aria-describedby=\"desc1\"> does not result in the MSAA acc-description property being populated with the text content of the referenced element, but in testing it with NVDA and JAWS found it still worked.  (i.e the description was announced when the control recieved focus.) asked@jcsteh how NVDA accesses the aria-describedby text in IE when it is not provided via the MSAA accessible description property Jamie responded: “We pull it from the DOM… which we have to do for a lot of stuff in IE. :(“    HTML5 and ARIA Boolean attributes  Clarified with @stommepoes that ARIA boolean attributes do not work the same as HTML5 boolean attributes, for example:  In HTML5 native boolean attributes <input type=text required> the presence of the attribute indicates the true state while the abscence indicates the false state: <input type=text> But even when used in HTML5 <input type=text aria-required> the presence of the aria-required attribute does not indicate the true state.

ViaÂ ShawnÂ LawtonÂ Henry  Firefox 14: image long description via link using aria-describedby  Posted on Friday, 11 May 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   In his latest article Mozilla accessibility engineer Alexander Surkov describes an interesting implementation development in FireFox 14, which is a possible solution using ARIA to provide a link to a long description on an image:  Using aria-describedby to provide a long description link on an image ARIA aria-describedby attribute used on HTML image element and pointing to HTML a element makes the image accessible to expose showlongdesc action. This action opens an URL provided by @href attribute on HTML a element in a new window. When the image has focus the screen reader user can press enter to activate the link, because a link action showlongdesc is exposed on the image, it uses the URL from the link referenced via aria-describedby.  code: Note: example from the test page. <figure> <img src=\"shalott.jpg\" aria-describedby=\"a\" alt=\"Painting of a  young woman with long hair, sitting in a wooden boat.\"> <figcaption> A painting inspired by Alfred Tennyson\\'s poem The Lady of Shalott. </figcaption> <p><a id=\"a\" href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/waterhouse-the-lady-of-shalott-n01543/text-summary\">Further information about the painting.</a></p> </figure> Notes:  This is an experimental implementaion only I DO NOT suggest anyone uses this method for anything other than testing. Only works in FireFox 14+ Although the accessible action is exposed and can be activated from the image when using a screen reader (when  virtual focus is on the image, pressing enter will open the link), there is no indication to user that the link can be activated from the image. From initial discussions with implementers and stakeholders, they are not keen this implementation Still works when the link is hidden using the HTML5 hidden attribute or CSS display:none Has the same UI issue as current longdesc attribute implementations: The link always opens in a new window/tab. test page   Using WAI-ARIA Roles and States with the YUI Menu Control  Posted on Saturday, 22 December 2007 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIA   Using WAI-ARIA Roles and States with the YUI Menu Control.Â YUI Menu authorÂ Todd KlootsÂ and Yahoo! accessibility guruÂ Victor TsaranÂ introduce the WAI-ARIA Roles and States  Describing aria-describedby  Posted on Wednesday, 5 September 2018 by Scott O\\'Hara  Category: Development   A well-designed user interface (UI) should clearly identify important content and controls. Often people correlate this to using prominent visual cues to help guide individuals through a task or point them to necessary information. However, what may be visually apparent to some could be misunderstood or completely passed over by others. If someone uses assistive technology to navigate an interface, understanding important cues or components could prove to be a different task than looking around the screen for prominent visual indicators. For starters, some people use a screen magnifier to assist with seeing a screen. When magnified, only portions of the entire screen will be visible at once, leaving dynamically revealed descriptions potentially out of sight. There are also those who cannot see at all. For these people, context provided by visually-dependent associations and dynamically revealed content could be skipped, or misunderstood if not announced with necessary context and helpful information. Others may be able to see the screen, but have difficulty understanding the UI without the aid of a screen reader announcing the content to them (For more information on how people may be using a screen reader, check out WebAim’s Screen Reader Survey). When building inclusive experiences, developers may need to look beyond the native accessibility of HTML elements and use ARIA attributes to augment the semantics of the HTML language. One such ARIA attribute, aria-describedby, provides the means to associate an element with the text of another object, or objects, in the document. When properly used, this attribute can provide the necessary information to assist in creating inclusive user experiences. Using aria-describedby As noted in Léonie Watson’s Short note on aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby, the aria-describedby attribute is most robustly supported when used with interactive elements (such as buttons, form controls, and links), or elements with a landmark or widget role. In all examples aria-describedby is meant to provide descriptive information about the element that might otherwise be missed. For example, a password text field with an explanation of what is valid user input: <label for=\"pw\">\\r   Password\\r </label>\\r <input type=\"password\" id=\"pw\" aria-describedby=\"pw_desc\">\\r \\r <p id=\"pw_desc\">\\r   Please enter a password you\\'ll immediately forget.\\r </p>\\r  To interact with a form the Tab key is used to move between form controls (inputs, textarea, select, etc.). As paragraphs are not inherently keyboard focusable, a person using a screen reader to navigate the form may completely miss the snarky password description. To help ensure the instructions are not missed, the paragraph is given a unique id for the aria-describedby attribute to reference. This will result in the announcement of the snarky content, after the accessible name and role of the password input, when focused. An example of when one might need to use aria-describedby on a non-interactive element would be in the context of a confirmation dialog, where an element within was automatically focused when the dialog loads. The following example shows an alert dialog with the least destructive control automatically focused with the autofocus attribute. <div role=\"alertdialog\" aria-labelledby=\"acc_name\" aria-describedby=\"acc_desc\">\\r   <h2 id=\"acc_name\">\\r     Are you sure?\\r   </h2>        \\r   <p id=\"acc_desc\">\\r     Once you delete this thing, it\\'s gone forever!\\r   </p>\\r   <button autofocus>\\r     Do not delete\\r   </button>\\r   <button>\\r     Delete\\r   </button>\\r </div>\\r  For many screen readers, this example will be announced like: “Are you sure? dialog. Once you delete this thing, it’s gone forever! Do not delete, button.” If aria-describedby had not been used in this example, a screen reader would have just announced “Are you sure? dialog. Do not delete, button”. It would then be on the screen reader user to navigate around the dialog to find any additional information, negating any benefit of auto-focusing the button in the first place. Complex descriptions Sometimes context is indicated by more than a single element. In these scenarios, one of the following methods can be used to point to more descriptive content: Using multiple ids The aria-describedby attribute can accept multiple space separated ids to create an announcement. The text of the referenced elements will be announced by the order of the ids . Consider the following as an example: <p id=\"desc_1\">\\r   Hide your email address by using a nickname for your account name.\\r </p>\\r <!-- ... -->\\r <label>\\r   Nickname:\\r   <input type=\"text\" aria-describedby=\"desc_2 desc_1\">\\r </label>\\r <p id=\"desc_2\">\\r   Do not use @ symbols in nicknames.\\r </p>\\r  Information as to why a user might want a nickname is provided in one area of the document, and requirements for the nickname text field are provided after the text field. The nickname input would be announced like: “Nickname, text field. Do not use @ symbols in nicknames. Hide your email address by using a nickname for your account name.” Note, the ordering of the ids is important, as the desc_2 text provides meaningful instructions in how to enter a nickname. desc_1 provides context that may have been passed over, but is not essential in filling out the text field. Referencing a single wrapper As an alternative to stringing together multiple ids, aria-describedby can reference a single element that contains multiple descriptive objects. <label>\\r   Password:\\r   <input type=\"password\" aria-describedby=\"desc_group\">\\r </label>\\r <div id=\"desc_group\">\\r   <p>A password must include the following:</p>\\r   <ul>\\r     <li>A capital letter.</li>\\r     <li>A number.</li>\\r     <li>A special character.</li>\\r     <li>No fewer than 75 characters.</li>\\r   </ul>\\r </div>\\r  Pointing to a single id can be far more sustainable when building reusable components. This is especially true if descriptive content is dynamically generated based on user settings or location. What might be a single line of descriptive text in some instances could be two or more depending on component use, language translations, current state, or other situational factors. Returning to the use of multiple ids, when a form control has both descriptive text and an error message, the id of the error message can be added to the aria-describedby attribute. For example, aria-describedby=\"error_msg desc_group\". Doing this will bridge the gap until the aria-errormessage attribute is available (hopefully in the not too distant future). Gotchas when describing content It should be noted that associating content with aria-describedby has some quirks, and some best practices that you should be aware of:  Be concise with descriptions. If your description goes into great detail, or includes a bunch of fluff, it may be difficult for people to follow. Any content referenced with aria-describedby will be concatenated into a single text string. It’s important to use punctuation, such as periods at the end of a complete thought, so the description won’t be announced as one run on sentence. If the semantics are important in the descriptive content, note that they will not be conveyed in the aria-describedby announcement. For example, images, links and lists won’t be announced as such. Only the `alt` attribute of an image will be announced, and only Firefox will announce “bullet” prior to announcing a list item. There will be no announcements made of any links within the descriptive content. aria-describedby content may not always be announced to users, depending on their screen reader and navigation method. The attribute is well supported, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some things to be aware of:  aria-describedby content may not be announced by all screen readers if navigating to a button, link, or form control with the virtual cursor. JAWS specifically may not announce an element’s description when using hot keys to navigate to certain elements. When navigating by visited links, the description will not be announced. However JAWS should announce descriptions when navigating by form controls. JAWS 17 + IE won’t announce aria-describedby content when tabbing to a link (newer version of JAWS have fixed this). IE11 won’t announce the accessible name or description of a form control if the `title` attribute is used in tandem with aria-describedby, and the user is navigating by virtual cursor or form control hot key (F). Both will be announced if using the Tab key. (IE11 had much bigger problems with aria-describedby in the past.) TalkBack + Android Chrome won’t announce any aria-describedby content of a modal dialog when auto-focusing an element within that dialog. If a user has descriptions or hint text turned off, any associated content won’t be announced. Because of this, it’s vital that any content that is necessary to the understanding of a UI be available by means other than just aria-describedby.    One last notable issue occurs when referencing a single container element with aria-describedby, rather than referencing multiple elements by their ids. A single id is definitely easier to maintain than stringing together multiple, but certain screen readers won’t always announce all the content nested within the referenced container. For instance, VoiceOver on both desktop and mobile will ignore announcing nested lists from a container element. Returning to the complex password example from earlier… <label>\\r   Password:\\r   <input type=\"password\" aria-describedby=\"desc_group\">\\r </label>\\r <div id=\"desc_group\">\\r   <p>A password must include the following:</p>\\r   <ul>\\r     <li>A capital letter.</li>\\r     <li>A number.</li>\\r     <li>A special character.</li>\\r     <li>No fewer than 75 characters.</li>\\r   </ul>\\r </div>\\r  VoiceOver will announce “A password must include the following:” as the description to the password input, leaving out all the listed requirements. Further testing shows other types of nested elements may be ignored as well. For instance, both JAWS and NVDA have issues with `figure` patterns. <div id=\"dialog\" role=\"dialog\" hidden aria-labelledby=\"d_head\" aria-describedby=\"instructions\">\\r   <h1 id=\"d_head\">Enter code</h1>\\r   <div id=\"instructions\">\\r     <p>The security number for your credit card was missing when checking out.</p>\\r     <figure>\\r       <img src=\"credit-card-security-location.jpg\" alt=\"security code shown on the right back side of credit card.\"\\r       <figcaption>\\r         Enter the number as shown.\\r       </figcaption>\\r     </figure>\\r   </div>\\r   <div>\\r     <label>\\r       Security Number\\r       <input id=\"focus\">  \\r     </label>\\r   </div>\\r   <button>\\r     OK\\r   </button>\\r </div>\\r  JAWS 2018 and NVDA 2018.2.1 with Firefox & Chrome will completely disregard the contents of the figure when the dialog is revealed, and the input is auto-focused. The description will only include the contents from the paragraph. Wrapping up aria-describedby is an important tool to help provide information where it might otherwise be missed. However, the attribute should rarely be the sole manner in which information is communicated, as doing so will exclude people not using screen readers from the descriptive content. The best way to use aria-describedby is as an alternate way to provide quick access to descriptions that are accessible by other means. As with any tool, ARIA attributes, including aria-describedby are best used appropriately and with care. Doing so, in tandem with working around the few (but important) gaps in support, can help provide inclusive user experiences that are understandable to all.  WAI-ARIA role support – How the browsers stack up  Posted on Monday, 16 March 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIATag: ChromeTag: FirefoxTag: Internet ExplorerTag: Safari   For the roles defined in WAI-ARIA it is expected that browsers expose the role values via an accessibility API, on the Windows platform the information is usually exposed using the Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) Application Programming Interface (API). Use of an Accessibility API such as MSAA means that Assistive Technology can access the role information ARIA provides employing the same methods they use to access role information of native HTML and desktop controls. Therefore an important piece of the ARIA support puzzle is the support browsers have for exposing ARIA roles using the MSAA API. The study ARIA roles exposed via MSAA by browsers on Windows provides test of the major browsers available for windows. ARIA roles exposed via MSAA by browsers on Windows – Summary WAI-ARIA has 59 possible role values (excluding abstract roles):  IE 8RC1 exposes 42 role values via MSAA Firefox (Minefield) 3.2a1pre exposes 49 role values via MSAA Opera 10 Alpha exposes 21 role values via MSAA Safari 4 Beta exposes 8 role values via MSAA Chrome exposes 0 role values via MSAA  Notes: For roles with an “Expected MSAA Role” value of “none” an incorrect or no role does not necessarily indicate that the ARIA role information is not available to Assistive Technology.  These ARIA roles do not have direct mapping with MSAA roles, but may be made available to assistive technology via the UIAutomation (UIA) API or the IAccessible2 (IA2). From preliminary testing using UISpy for UIA and Accprobe for IA2, it was found that none of the ARIA roles without a corresponding MSAA role were exposed via either UIAutomation or IAccessible2. In the case of the ARIA Landmark roles for example, the JAWS screen reader supports them, although they are not exposed using an accessibility API. It is surmised that JAWS picks them up from the browsers HTML DOM.   Brief history of browser accessibility support  Posted on Wednesday, 5 October 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The development of a ‘Brief history of browser accessibility support‘ was prompted by Google’s Evolution of the Web interactive infographic. I was dazzled by its coolness, but noticed that amongst all the web technologies ARIA 1.0 was not to be found. ARIA is included in the makeup of the open web stack.  This got me thinking that it would be useful to have an infographic showing the timeline for implementations of the various accessibility APIs and accessibility related technical specifications. Below is a rather large thumbnail version of the (non interactive infographic, based on the ‘Evolution of the Web’). There is also a full size version and related timeline available.

The W3C defines ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) as a syntax for making dynamic Web content and custom UI accessible. Internet Explorer 8 uses ARIA role, state, and property information to communicate with assistive technologies. Instead of building separate simplified Web pages for accessibility, you can use ARIA to markup your rich Web applications with roles, states, and properties. For example, to match the behavior you create through script, you can define a DIV element as a button, checkbox, or another ARIA role. Source: Internet Explorer 8 Readiness Toolkit Rich Schwerdtfeger one the principle architects of the WAI ARIA specifications responded to the news on his blog: I was elated to find that Microsoft has added support for WAI-ARIA in Internet Explorer 8.

Over time the necessity of explicitly assigning landmarks will lessen as browsers build in ARIA landmark roles to newer HTML element semantics. There is widespread support for ARIA landmarks in browsers and screen readers.  How ARIA landmark roles help screen reader users In this video Leonie Watson demonstrates how ARIA landmark roles help screen reader users understand the purpose of different areas of a web page, such as search, navigation or main content. ARIA Landmark Roles The WAI ARIA specification defines a set of specialised “landmark” roles. These roles provide a method to programmatically identify commonly found sections of web page content in a consistent way. they can be used now in whatever flavour of (X)HTML you prefer. This allows assistive technologies to provide users with features which they can use to identify and navigate to sections of page content. Information about WAI – ARIA landmarks from WAI-ARIA Best Practices (Editors’ Draft 6 August 2010) Landmarks are a vast improvement over the rudimentary “skip to main content” technique employed prior to WAI-ARIA. If possible it is best to use these as landmarks. … The presence of common, semantic, navigation landmarks allows each site to support the same standard and allows your assistive technology to provide a consistent navigation experience – an important feature for screen readers and alternate input solutions. For users with cognitive and learning disabilities the landmark information could be used to expand and collapse these regions of your page to aid in simplifying the user experience by allowing the user to manage the amount of information processed at any one time. There are also mainstream benefits of providing navigation landmarks. Your browser may assign key sequences to move focus to these sections as they can be set on every site. Navigation to these landmarks is device independent. A personal digital assistant (PDA) could assign a device key to get to them in your document. How to use landmark roles It is a painless process to add landmark roles to existing (and new) pages. Simply add a role attribute to a container element, using the most appropriate role value for the content of the container, for example: <main role=\"main\">  An example page with ARIA landmark roles A list and descriptions of landmark roles is available in Table 1  Please note: Probably the most important rule for applying landmarks is to ensure all content resides in a landmark region to ensure no content is orphaned. This way a screen reader user can safely use landmark navigation without missing content. Rich Schwerdtfeger Adding Landmark Roles to WordPress I added them to the TPG blog (uses WordPress) in about 20 minutes, it involved the editing of the following WordPress files: sidebar.php (added complementary, navigation (x2) and search landmarks), header.php (added banner landmark), single.php (added main landmark), footer.php (added contentinfo landmark) & index.php (added main landmark). The results can be visualised using The Juicy Studio Accessibility Toolbar document landmarks feature:  Support for Landmark Roles Landmark roles are supported in JAWS, NVDA, ORCA, Chromevox, Window Eyes and VoiceOver and via a FireFox addon for keyboard users. Landmark Support behaviour in JAWS version 10 and above For JAWS version 10 and above, landmark keyboard navigation in virtual mode is:  next landmark ; (semi-colon) previous landmark SHIFT + ; (semi-colon) list landmarks CTRL + INS + ; (semi-colon)  When cycling through landmarks using the semi-colon key, the landmark role name +”landmark” is announced. A user can then cursor (down arrow key) to the content. If a landmark is a container for other landmarks it is not included within the cycle order, but is included within the list order. By default the list does not display nested landmarks, but when a nested landmark container item receives focus, it is announced to the user that the list item is closed, informing the user that the item has sub items. A user can then use the right arrow key to open the sub list.   ARIA Landmark Role Tests Detailed information about current assistive technology support can be found in the accompanying document ARIA Landmark Role Tests (November, 2011). What about the new Sectioning Elements in HTML5 The new sectioning elements in HTML5 have some overlap with ARIA landmark roles, but in a majority of cases there is no equivalent for the ARIA landmark roles in HTML5. It is suggested that where there is a similarity the ARIA roles can be used to provide semantic identification that has a practical use now, for example if you want to use the HTML5 nav element, add role=\"navigation\" to it, so supporting Assistive Technology (AT) can convey the semantic information to users. When HTML5 elements such as nav are supported by AT, you can then remove the role as it will no longer be required. <nav role=\"navigation\"> For an example of the use of HTML5 elements and ARIA landmark roles have a look at code of  Bruce Lawson’s site. Comparison of ARIA landmark roles and HTML5 structural elements    ARIA Landmark Role HTML5 Sectioning Element        role=\"banner\" A region that contains the prime heading or internal title of a page. Most of the content of a banner is site-oriented, rather than being page-specific. Site-oriented content typically includes things such as the logo of the site sponsor, the main heading for the page, and site-specific search tool. Typically this appears at the top of the page spanning the full width. Note: Within any document or application, the author SHOULD mark no more than one element with the banner role. No HTML5 element equivalent. Recommended to be used on one header element per page if the header element is used as described for role=”banner”.   role=\"complementary\" A supporting section of the document that remains meaningful even when separated from the main content.There are various types of content that would appropriately have this role. For example, in the case of a portal, this may include but not be limited to show times, current weather, related articles, or stocks to watch. The content should be relevant to the main content; if it is completely separable, a more general role should be used instead. <aside> The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.   role=\"contentinfo\" Metadata that applies to the parent document.For example, footnotes, copyrights, and links to privacy statements would belong here.Note: Within any document or application, the author SHOULD mark no more than one element with the contentinfo role. No HTML5 element equivalent. Recommended to be used on one footer element per page if the footer element is used as described for role=”contentinfo”.   role=\"form\" A region of the document that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing. Recommend using on a semantically neutral element such as a div not on a form element, as the element already has default role semantics exposed.   role=\"main\" The main content of a document. This marks the content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of the document. Within any document or application, the author SHOULD mark no more than one element with the main role. Note: Within any document or application, the author SHOULD mark no more than one element with the main role. The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central functionality of an application.   role=\"navigation\" A collection of navigational elements (usually links) for navigating the document or related documents.  The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.   role=\"search\" The search tool of a web document. This is typically a form used to submit search requests about the site or to a more general Internet search service. No HTML5 element equivalent. Recommend using on a semantically neutral element such as a div or on a form element, if the form contains only search related controls and instructions.

Support for HTML5 hidden and aria-hidden in 2016 Summary All major browsers and screen readers:  support the use of the hidden attribute to hide content support the use of the CSS display:none to hide content support the use of the aria-hidden attribute to hide visible content from screen reader users  The Details Screen reader support for hidden content – tests and results for  Windows 10  Firefox 43 Internet Explorer 11 Chrome 47 JAWS 17 Window Eyes 9 NVDA 2015.4 Narrator 10   VoiceOver on iOS 9.2.1 (iPhone 6) VoiceOver on OSX El Capitan ChromeVox  on Chrome OS 47 Orca 3.16 on Linux  Notes: In some browser and screen reader combinations aria-hidden=false on an element that is hidden using the hidden attribute or CSS display:none results in the content being unhidden. This behaviour does not have consensus support among browser implementers and I strongly recommend, it not be used. Why no Edge testing? The Edge browser does not yet have sufficient accessibility support for testing to be useful. The hidden attribute hides content due to browser’s implementation of CSS display:none on content hidden using the attribute. If the default UA CSS is overidden, then aria-hidden=true will have to be used alongside the hidden attribute: See the Pen gPvoNR by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.

ARIA in HTML – there goes the neighborhood  Posted on Wednesday, 1 October 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Will HTML5 make the use of WAI-ARIA in HTML redundant? the short answer is definitely not. There are many ARIA roles and properties that are not provided by native elements and attributes in HTML5. Also developers still have the desire to roll their own interactive controls or web components even though they have been available in HTML as native elements for 15 years, why would this suddenly change with HTML5?  First rule of ARIA use (never forget): If you can use a native HTML element [HTML5] or attribute with the semantics and behaviour you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so. Using ARIA in HTML  Examples from real world web apps : a button and a link Developers have had for 15 years a number of native elements they can use for buttons and the a element for links, provided in HTML 4, all of which provide built in mouse and keyboard interaction and convey role, state and name properties to accessibility APIs:  input type=\"button\" input type=\"image\" button element a element  But still in 2014 companies like Twitter and Google, choose to emulate a button with code (not to mention the associated scripting) such as this:  <a data-placement=\"bottom\" class=\"js-tooltip global-dm-nav\" href=\"#\" role=\"button\"  data-original-title=\"Direct messages\">  <span class=\"Icon Icon--dm Icon--large\"></span>  <span class=\"dm-new\"><span class=\"count-inner\"></span></span>  <span class=\"visuallyhidden\">Direct messages</span>  </a>  Or this  <div tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" act=\"20\" class=\"T-I J-J5-Ji nu T-I-ax7 L3\"  style=\"-moz-user-select: none;\" data-tooltip=\"Refresh\" aria-label=\"Refresh\"> <div class=\"asa\"> <div class=\"asf T-I-J3 J-J5-Ji\"> </div></div></div> and a link like this:  <div role=\"link\" tabindex=\"0\" idlink=\"\" class=\"py pr\" id=\":i\"> <h2 id=\":k\" class=\"pw\">Quick Links</h2> <div class=\"qn\"></div></div> Note: First example from twitter, others are  from Google’s Gmail application. The reason is probably because they cannot apply the styles they want to native interactive elements, but who knows? What is important for accessibility is if developers choose to code in this way, they now have a method to provide the needed accessibility information. It would be preferable that they used the available native HTML elements, but if they do not, then ARIA provides what HTML alone cannot. ARIA used in native HTML implementations (there goes the neighborhood): Chrome uses ARIA to map roles and properties from the HTML DOM to accessibility APIs in its native HTML implementation of input type=”week” <input type=\"week\"> #shadow root (user agent) <div pseudo=\"-webkit-datetime-edit\" id=\"date-time-edit\" datetimeformat=\"\\'Week \\'ww, yyyy\"> <div pseudo=\"-webkit-datetime-edit-fields-wrapper\"> <div pseudo=\"-webkit-datetime-edit-text\">Week </div> <span role=\"spinbutton\" aria-valuetext=\"blank\" aria-valuemin=\"1\"  aria-valuemax=\"53\" pseudo=\"-webkit-datetime-edit-week-field\">--</span> <div pseudo=\"-webkit-datetime-edit-text\">, </div> <span role=\"spinbutton\" aria-valuetext=\"blank\" aria-valuemin=\"1\" aria-valuemax=\"275760\"   pseudo=\"-webkit-datetime-edit-year-field\">----</span> </div></div> </input> Aria roles and properties not available in HTML5 Below are listed the ARIA roles and properties. not considered to be available natively in HTML5.

Use of an Accessibility API means that Assistive Technology can access the role information ARIA provides employing the same methods they use to access role information of native HTML and desktop controls. Therefore an important piece of the ARIA support puzzle on a MAC OS is the support browsers have for exposing ARIA roles using the The Mac OS X Accessibility Protocol. The study ARIA role tests on MAC provides tests of the major browsers available for MAC OS X. ARIA role tests on MAC – Safari 4 beta Firefox 3 (minefield) & Opera 10 Alpha – Summary WAI-ARIA has 59 possible role values (excluding abstract roles):  Firefox (Minefield) 3.2a1pre exposes 0 role values correctly via the MAC accessibility API Opera 10 Alpha exposes 14 role values correctly via the MAC accessibility API Safari 4 Beta exposes 15 role values correctly via The MAC accessibility API  Notes: The inital motivation for collecting this data was a post by Roger Johansson – Safari 4 public beta with WAI-ARIA support. Or not?, which prompted me to start looking more at how ARIA is supported by Safari on MAC. (thanks Roger!) I was also mindful of the use of such information in general terms for helping to work out which bit of the implementation is broken; Is it my code or the browser or the assistive tech that is not working as it should? Furthermore as part of my work for the W3C Protocols and Formats Working Group, who are responsible for the WAI ARIA specification, I thought this information would be a useful resource. Yesterday’s post WAI-ARIA role support – How the browsers stack up lead to some unfortunate statements being made about the relative priorities of browser vendors when it comes to accessibility. While I do think when it comes to accessibility and support for WAI ARIA in particular, Mozilla leads the pack and Microsoft is doing good work (some may think suprisingly), all browser vendors are making an effort to support WAI ARIA and in the process improving the general accessibility of their browsers and web content to Assistive Technology. In regards to Google chrome: I wrote about the Accessibility of Google Chrome when it was first released, which I think was and still is underwhelming, but Jonas Klink from Google has been doing some great work , details of which can be found in the Chrome Accessibility Design and Implementation Roadmap. It would be nice though, to see Google put more resources into Chrome accessibility… So all in all we are moving in the right direction, while some are moving slower than others, they are still moving.  Latest ARIA landmark support data  Posted on Monday, 21 November 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Noting that the landmark support test results I conducted back in July 2011 were being tweeted recently, I though it would be good to update the results.  ChromeVox support data has been added, thanks to @KevinChao89 for the ChromeVox keystroke info. VoiceOver testing on OSX lion has been added, thanks to @hanshillen for  testing. ARIA landmark support summary data  Jaws 11/12/13 has complete support. ChromeVox has complete support. VoiceOver supports all landmarks except “form”. NVDA supports all landmarks except “application” and “form”. Window Eyes does not support ARIA landmarks.

The slides from the presentation WAI-ARIA It’s Easy are now available. It was an interesting conference and it was great to hear renowned speakers such as Nate Koechley from Yahoo! and John Resig of JQuery fame, talking enthusisatically about the potential of WAI-ARIA!  ARIA role support: how the Windows browsers stack up – Update  Posted on Friday, 2 October 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Testing of the latest builds of the major Windows browsers indicates Google Chrome’s ARIA role support improving, 18 of  47 roles are now correctly mapped to MSAA roles. There has been no change in Opera or IE support and only minimal improvement in Safari/Webkit support. There has been a minor regression in Firefox support in the latest Minefield build.  The reported regression in Firefox was due to a reporting tool error. All ARIA roles are correctly mapped in Firefox. Current levels of ARIA support in Chrome/Opera/Safari and their lack of support for assistive technology (on Windows) in general, means the only browsers currently usable by assistive technology users and the only browsers that can currently claim practical ARIA support are Firefox 3+ and Internet Explorer 8.  Summary of Results 47 (of the 59) WAI-ARIA roles can be mapped to MSAA roles:  IE 8RC1 exposes 43 role values correctly Firefox (Minefield) 3.6 exposes 47 role values correctly Opera 10.10 beta exposes 21 role values correctly Webkit Nightly 23/09/09 exposes 10 role values correctly Chrome exposes 3.0 exposes 18 role values correctly  Detailed Results: ARIA roles exposed via MSAA by browsers on Windows – Webkit Nightly 23/09/09, Opera 10.10, IE 8, Firefox (minefield) 3.6b1pre & Chrome 3.0  Hands-On Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) @ SXSW Interactive 2009  Posted on Saturday, 9 August 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Conferences Tag: ARIA    Martin Kliehm has proposed a panel for South by Southwest (SXSW) held March 13-17, 2009 in Austin, Texas. : ‘Hands-On Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)’ .

HTML5 Accessibility Chops: ‘real world’ ARIA landmark use  Posted on Wednesday, 18 April 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   I tweeted yesterday about initial results of data crunching on ARIA landmark role use on the top 10,000 web sites HTML home page code samples. What I found is very encouraging.  ARIA role=banner usage As per the ARIA specification there should only be 1 role=banner per page. Of the 93 pages found to include the banner role:  90 pages had 1 instance (97%)  2 pages had 2 instances 1 page had 4 instances  ARIA role=main usage As per the ARIA specification there should only be 1 role=main per page. Of the 130 pages found to include the main role:  124 pages had 1 instance (95%)  1 pages had 2 instances 1 page had 3 instances 1 page had 4 instances 1 page had 7 instances 2 pages had 10 instances: The daily What & fail blog which look to be affiliated sites using the same template.  ARIA role=contentinfo usage As per the ARIA specification there should only be 1 role=contentinfo per page. Of the 72 pages found to include the contentinfo role:  69 pages had 1 instance (96%)  1 pages had 2 instances 1 page had 2 instances 1 page had 26 instances 1 page had 72 instances  Other analysis:  There was found to be a high correlation between use of the ARIA landmark roles  and use of the HTML5 doctype. For example of the 130 pages containing role=main, 101 (78%) also used the HTML5 doctype. Typically role=main was included on a div element and there was a high correlation between use of role=main and id values such as “main” (39 instances) and “content” (34 instances). role=”contentinfo” was used in conjunction with the footer element on 36/69 (52%) of instances. role=banner was used in conjunction with the header element on 41/93 (44%) of instances. The use of any landmark roles across the 8900 or so sample pages was low (approx. 3%), but use was considerably higher (17%) on the subset of pages (1539) that used the HTML5 doctype. role= search was found on 103 pages, 90 had 1 instance, 13 had 2 instances. role=application was found on only 5 pages, which is a good result considering the issues that can arise through its misuse.  Conclusion From an initial analysis the correct use of ARIA landmark roles is surprisingly high. Developers are generally using ARIA landmark roles as intended. Although use is low, there is an major upward trend in use as sites switch to HTML5.

The divergent opinions are mirrored in the differing author conformance requirements between the W3C HTML5 specification and the WHATWG living standard.  Note: this information is now being actively maintained as part of Using ARIA in HTML.  The W3C HTML5 specification Does not prohibit authors from applying the default implicit role as defined in the WAI-ARIA section of the specification. The WHATWG living standard Does prohibit authors/developers from adding default implicit ARIA semantics to HTML elements: Authors must not set the ARIA role and aria-* attributes to values that match the default implicit ARIA semantics Addition of default implicit roles – what does it do? For example, the default implied ARIA role for an a element that creates a hyperlink is the ARIA link role. So in the W3C HTML5 specification it is not forbidden to do this: <a href=\"http://www.html5accessibility.com\" role=\"link\">HTML5 Accessibility</a> The addition of the role does nothing as the a element has been around for yonks and the role value mapped in accessibility APIs, in browsers that support accessibility, is already implemented by the browser. So in effect it is the same as this: <a href=\"http://www.html5accessibility.com\">HTML5 Accessibility</a> When the information being exposed by Accessibility APIs is viewed using an inspect tool, it can be seen that there is no difference between the 2 examples, both expose (in the case of FireFox on Windows via MSAA and IAcessible2) the following: MSAA  Name:\\tHTML5 Accessibility Value:\\thttp://www.html5accessibility.com/ Role:\\tlink State:\\tfocusable , focused , linked , traversed Description:\\t(none)  IAccessible2  Name:\\tHTML5 Accessibility Value:\\thttp://www.html5accessibility.com/ Role:\\tlink State:\\tHorizontal, Opaque, Selectable text Description:\\t(none)  Redundant roles The ARIA role in this case is redundant as the browser has already done the job of conveying the semantics. The addition of the role has no effect, it is not necessary but does no harm. Authors do not need to and should be made aware that they do not need to add roles for the default semantics of accessibility supported elements, but if they do its not the end of the world. Accessibility Supported elements Authors/developers can safely assume that any element that has been around since HTML 4.0 is already accessibility supported in browsers that support accessibility. So they do not need a default implicit role added. The situation for new HTML5 elements is different and likely to remain so for some time. It will be years before New HTML5 elements get robust accessibility support implemented across browsers and platforms. This is particularly so for non interactive elements such as the new HTML5 structural elements because  accessibility APIs in general do not have defined roles for many non interactive elements. In this case it is recommended to add the appropriate ARIA roles to elements that are meant to convey meaning but are effectively meaningless due to lack of implemented accessibility support. For example, adding role=navigation to a nav element fills the gaps in support for HTML5 semantics as ARIA  is more robustly  supported by most modern browsers and assistive technology: <nav role=”navigation”> Unlike the WHATWG living standard, the W3C HTML5 specification has a more realistic stance towards the use of default implicit roles, as it allows authors to use ARIA to fill the gaps in browser implementation support. What do Validation tools do? Currently, the 2 main HTML5 conformance checkers (validator.nu and W3C Nu markup Validation Service) do not flag the presence of a default implicit role as an error, so in this respect they follow the HTML5 specification author conformance requirements for use of the ARIA role attribute. What should Validation tools do? HTML documents should not be considered invalid due to the addition of implicit roles. Given that it has not been shown that the addition of implicit roles does any harm, is unnecessary in some cases, but useful in other cases, it is suggested a nuanced warning message, not an error would be appropriate.

Further Reading:  Free-ARIA CommunityÂ Launched Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) Version 1.0, Working Draft WAI-ARIA Primer, Working Draft WAI-ARIA Best Practices, Working Draft   Comparison of ARIA roles exposed via MSAA and UI Automation in IE8  Posted on Tuesday, 26 May 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: ARIA   The Microsoft MSAA API cannot provide mapping for all ARIA roles as it does not have defined roles and properties for all those defined by The ARIA specification, the Microsoft UI Automation API can. UI automation provides exposure of all WAI-ARIA roles and properties via the ControlType and AriaRole properties.  Testing UI Automation AriaRole support Testing of the AriaRole properties support requires the Windows 7 operating system and the use of an updated inspect tool, currently only available as part of the Windows 7 SDK. Results from initial testing show that all possible ARIA role values are correctly exposed via the UI automation AriaRole property, but the stated mapping of the ARIA roles to UI automation ControlType is incomplete. I have also re-tested MSAA role mapping taking into account roles that Microsft documented as unsupported via MSAA:  43 out of 51 – Of the 51 WAI-ARIA role (excluding abstract roles) values that can be mapped to MSAA: Internet explorer 8.0.7100.0 maps 43 correctly. 32 out of 50 – Of the 50 WAI-ARIA role (excluding abstract roles) values that can be mapped to UI automation ControlType: Internet explorer 8.0.7100.0 maps 32 correctly. 59 out of 59 – Of the 59 WAI-ARIA role (excluding abstract roles) values that can be mapped via UI automation AriaRole property: Internet explorer 8.0.7100.0 maps 59 correctly.  Full Test Results: Comparison of ARIA roles exposed via MSAA and UI Automation in IE8 Practical Ramifications of these Results In theory by using the UI Automation API, assistive technology can access all the ARIA role values used in web pages viewed using Internet Explorer 8 via the AriaRole property. Although this property can only be tested in Windows 7, the property itself should be available to Assistive Technology on Vista and XP. I emailed Michael Curran, one of the developers of the NVDA screen reader, to pick his brains on UI automation, here is what he had to say: Technically, the properties are available on the other operating systems, but there is no real easy way for an AT to actually get at UI Automation in general, unless running on Windows 7. NVDA, and I’m sure many other ATs, do not make use of UI Automation in Internet Explorer, as we already access the DOM directly. And although we think its great that Microsoft is exposing this info via accessibility APIs now, the older way of getting at this info still works. Also, I said that its pretty impossible for ATs to get at UI Automation in Vista / XP. This is true, but here is a little further detail:  ATs written on the .net platform (since 2.0 I believe) have been able to access UI Automation through a managed API. However, very few ATs are written in .net, in particular I know of know screen readers that are. UIAutomationCore.dll was only introduced in Windows Vista. This is code that allows any normal win32 application to implement UI Automation in their GUI. This then means that although there may be some .net applications that expose UI Automation information running in XP, no native win32 application can expose UI Automation unless running on Windows Vista or above I believe. This does seem to mean then that I might have been wrong about saying that IE would expose UIA properties in XP, especially when IE is not a .net application I believe. Although the new unmanaged UI Automation client API is only available in Windows 7, it would be possible for an AT to inject “in process” and use UI Automation directly in applications such as Internet Explorer, in Windows Vista. Many ATs already inject in process to read web pages anyway, however as I previously noted, I’m not too sure on the uptake of this method as many ATs already have full access to the DOM.  As you can see, the whole UI Automation story is extremely complex, and I guess still not fully complete. Thanks to Michael for providing such detailed information! The main point for me in relation to WAI-ARIA is that “many ATs already have full access to the DOM.” which suggests that as long as ARIA is being exposed correctly via the DOM and AT’s have access to the DOM, they can implement ARIA.  Using aria-describedby to provide helpful form hints  Posted on Tuesday, 23 December 2014 by Léonie Watson  Category: Strategy   When a form field has a label, screen readers will announce it automatically when focus moves to the field. If additional information is available to help people complete the task, it’s also a good idea to associate it with the field in question.  Quick label recap:  <label for=\"password\">Choose a password</label> <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" …>  If this field was included in a form for creating a new account, the field might have the following additional information displayed:  <label for=\"password\">Choose a password</label> <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" …>  <p>Your password must be at least 10 characters in length. It must contain a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers and punctuation marks.</p>  The additional information will be visually styled and positioned to make its relationship to the field apparent. However, a screen reader user who tabs through the form (from one field to the next) will be completely unaware that the additional information exists. The aria-describedby attribute is used to provide an accessible description for an object within the user interface. Where the programmatically associated label provides the field’s accessible name, the aria-describedby attribute associates the field with the additional information to provide the field’s accessible description.  <label for=\"password\">Choose a password</label> <input type=\"password\" id=\"password\" aria-describedby=\"hint\" ...>  <p id=\"hint\">Your password must be at least 10 characters in length. It must contain a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers and punctuation marks.</p>  The aria-describedby attribute takes the idref of the paragraph containing the additional information as its value. It works in the same way as the for/id attribute pairing between the <label> and the <input>. Note: it is possible to associate multiple sources of information using aria-describedby. Refer to Notes on Using ARIA in HTML for more information. When a screen reader focuses on the field in this example, it will announce the label, the type of field, then the additional information (in that order). One of the advantages of this is that the additional information is announced last, so screen reader users are not obliged to listen to it every time they move to that field. They can listen to it if they choose, but if not they can listen to the label announcement and then carry on without waiting for the rest.  HTML5 Accessibility Chops: ARIA role=alert browser support  Posted on Thursday, 21 June 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: StandardsCategory: Testing   For a more recent set of results, see ARIA alert support (April 2017) ARIA role=alert is supported across modern browsers and assistive technology, but implementation in browsers differ, which can lead to role=alert appearing to be unsupported.  role=alert what does it do? When an element has a role=alert is displayed it triggers an alert event in the browsers implemented accessibility APIs. This is picked up by assistive technology (AT) and the text content of the element is announced, usually suffixed or prefixed by the word “alert”. It does not move focus in the browser or assistive technology to the element, it just causes the text content of the element to be announced. This is useful because on screen messages can be conveyed to AT users without breaking the flow of their page navigation or current focus. They get a similar experience to other users when a text message is displayed. The WAI-ARIA Authoring Guide states: Use the alert role for a one-time notification which shows for a period of time and goes away and is intended to alert the user that something has happened. Note: role=alert is one of the numerous ARIA features that are not available as native HTML features. Different methods There are numerous methods for displaying content on the page after the page has loaded. Trouble is in some browsers the differing methods do not all have the desired effect of triggering the alert event in the browser when role=alert is present on the displayed content. Method 1 createElement(), insertAttribute(), createTextNode() and appendchild() Using this method a text alert can be displayed on the page by:  creating a new element adding a role attribute with a value of alert creating the text content appending the text content to the created element  Note: this method only currently works with FireFox and Chrome Method 2 innerHTML Using this method an element with a role attribute with a value of alert and text content can be added to the page: elementX.innerHTML = “<div role=’alert’>alert text</div>”; Note: this method only currently works with FireFox and Chrome Method 3 display:none to display:block|inline etc. Using this method an element already in the DOM with a role attribute with a value of alert and text content can be displayed on the page. Note: this method only currently works with IE, FireFox and Chrome Method 4: createTextNode + constraints Note: unfortunately method 4 is a big hack, but it is the only method that provides support across browsers/AT and platforms. Using this method, an existing element with no text content can have text content added. There are additional constraints on this method to make it work with IE, Chrome and Safari (Mac/iPhone/iPad). Working example: Test Page – method 4 basic: alertText = document.createTextNode(\"alert text\");  elementX.appendChild(alertText); Constraints:  The element cannot be hidden (For safari) prior to adding the text so used CSS clip() and change before additon of text. The elements CSS visibility property must be toggled (for IE) Need an additional role=alert on outer container element and then only set the role=alert on the inner element via scripting prior to adding text.  To achieve this  outer element has its CSS clip property initially set to rect(0px,0px,0px,0px), the inner element has role=alert added and the outer element CSS clip property is set to auto via scripting (for Chrome), then after (for Safari) the text node is added, the CSS visibility property is toggled (for IE). HTML: <div id=\"display2\" role=\"alert\">  <span id=\"add1\"></span>  </div> JavaScript: function addError(){  //set role attribute on inner element  elem1.setAttribute(\"role\", \"alert\");  ? //change initial clip property to auto  document.getElementById(\\'display2\\').style.clip=\\'auto\\';  // create and append the text node  alertText = document.createTextNode(\"alert via createTextnode()\");  elem1.appendChild(alertText);  //toggle visibility from visible to hidden and back again  elem1.style.visibility=\\'hidden\\';  elem1.style.visibility=\\'visible\\';  } CSS: /* clip set to hide element initially as it cannot be hidden by display:none or visibility:hidden for Safari compatibility */  #elem1 {  clip:rect(0px,0px,0px,0px);  } Note: this method as described works with FireFox, Chrome, IE on Windows and Safari (Mac, iPhone and iPad?). Which browsers support which methods? If the display of the alert text triggered an MSAA  SYS_ALERT event (on Windows) the method is considered as supporting role=alert, after ad hoc testing with NVDA and JAWS.  On Mac, iPhone and iPad? if VoiceOver announces the alert text the method is considered as supporting role=alert. Note: Results marked with an asterisk indicate that while a particular method is supported, support is brittle as , for example, an alert is not triggered if the method is reinstantiated on the same page after the initial use. In other words the only browser with robust support is Firefox.    browser method 1 method 2 method 3 method 4   FireFox 13 Yes Yes Yes Yes   IE 9 No No Yes *  Yes *    Chrome 19 Yes *  Yes *  Yes *  Yes *    Safari 5 (Mac/iPad/iPhone) No No No Yes *     Differing browser implementations are a pain in the A As can be seen from the above information, due to the IE and Safari support issues getting role=alert to work cross browser & cross AT is extremely painful, but as shown it is possible. Perhaps I am missing something and a lot simpler solution is out there, If so please share! Testing methodology accevent application with a SYS_ALERT event displayed  Test page – all methods Test Page – method 4  On Mac, iPhone and iPad, VoiceOver was used with Safari, to test the various methods. On windows for Firefox, IE and Chrome, accevent was used to listen for the SYS_ALERT event to fire when the text alert was displayed. Also JAWS, and NVDA were used to verify wheter the alert text was announced. Note: JAWS worked fine with IE for all methods as it does not rely upon the SYS_ALERT event, but NVDA only works in IE with method 4 as it does rely on the SYS_ALERT event.  Accessibility in a Web Components World at MakingWeb  Posted on Friday, 26 September 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Yesterday I had the pleasure of presenting at the 2nd MakingWeb conference in Norway, I talked about web components. Web Component Accessibility The key points I attempted to convey during the presentation: An accessible, usable UI is a MUST UI accessibility is not an accessory, a ‘nice to have’. If a UI is not accessible it’s incomplete, substandard, half baked – a neckbeard UI There are no new demons There is nothing inherent within web components as a technology that makes it harder to build usable and accessible UI’s The challenges remain the same The challenges with web components are pretty much the same as what we have dealt with for years with HTML/JavaScript custom controls Build accessibility in from the start  Create custom elements by extending native HTML elements, wherever practical, as you will then get much of the accessibility for free.  Example – Building an Accessible Disclosure Button – using Web Components   When creating custom element attributes pair them with ARIA attributes wherever the semantics align.  Example – Building an Accessible Disclosure Button – using Web Components   Use standardized, defined interaction patterns for custom controls.

A feature it provides is Web Finder, which makes use of HTML semantics to provide navigation to, interaction with, and understanding of content structure. ZoomText Web Finder The product page describes it thus: ZoomText’s Enhanced Web Finder allows you to search webpages for specific words or phrases, or skim through pages to find items of interest. When an item of interest is found you can have Web Finder start reading aloud from that location (Magnifier/Reader only). If the item is a link to another page you can have Web Finder execute the link and continue your search on the new page. The Web Finder provides a user interface which lists various HTML elements found in a page and allows the user to navigate to and interact with these elements. It can be used with either the magnifier only or with speech enabled.  Web Finder can be enabled by pressing the Web button located in the Finders section of the Magnifier tab. Note: the Web button will be disabled unless the currently currently active application is one that ZoomText recognizes as a web browser. Supported Browsers Web Finder currently works with Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer on Windows. Note: ZoomText appears to have issues with pre Windows 10, pre IE 11 combinations. Whilst you can activate the Web Finder when running Opera, no semantics are recognized. If you open Microsoft Edge with ZoomText running, the following dialog is displayed:  [Dialog text:] You just started Microsoft Edge to browse the Internet or to view a PDF file.  Microsoft Edge is not fully accessible by ZoomText at this time. Please use Internet Explorer to browse the web and Microsoft Reader to view PDF files. To make these the default programs for these tasks, select the following link. Supported Semantics In Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer the following HTML features are recognised and listed (if present in the page):  Headings h1-h6 Landmarks (native HTML5  – header, footer, main, section, aside, nav) identified as type role name landmark. For example the header element and any element with role=banner are identified as Banner landmark  Notes:  The article element is also included as a landmark with the type section: HTML5 article.  Which is funky on a few levels: article is not a landmark and the use of “HTML5” as part of the type, this does not provide any useful information to the large majority of users, most of which have no idea what HTML5 is and why it is called out in reference to the ‘article’ type. header and footer elements only recognised as landmarks (and listed) if scoped to the body element (as per the HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 specification)   Lists (ol, ul and dl) Controls: A limited set of controls are identified – buttons (input type=\"image|button|reset|submit\" and the button element, checkboxes input type=\"checkbox\", comboboxes (select element), edit boxes (input type=\"text|search|url|tel|email\"), multiline text boxes (textarea element) and radio buttons input type=\"radio\". links (a href) images (img elements) forms (form elements)  Name and Type The semantics are conveyed to users via 2 pieces of information name and type, with elements present in the page displayed in a listbox For example, headings listed from a headings example page:  In the case of headings (and Landmarks), the name is derived from the first descendant text node in the source order unless the element has a name provided by the title, aria-label or aria-labelledby attributes, in which case these sources are used. In the case of buttons (and other supported controls), if the control allows child text nodes, then these are used to provide the name, unless the element has a name provided by the  aria-label or aria-labelledby attributes, in which case these sources are used. Note: If a button has no child text node but has a title, the attribute content is used as the name. It is heartening to note that the name calculation used reflects the HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0 specification. In cases where there is a name and a description provided (via title or aria-describedby) these are displayed in the listbox name field separated by a | pipe character:  Note: state attributes are unsupported, so for example if a button is disabled (via the disabled attribute) there will be no indication in the list that this is the case. What can users do with all this?  Users can filter the list to find the types of content they want, and can choose an item from the list to move to that item in the web page (by double clicking, hotkey or the Goto button) and have it highlighted, and spoken (if using reader functionality). They can also activate controls and links directly from within the Web Finder interface via the Execute button. What about ARIA? From the content above you may already realise that Web Finder supports ARIA landmark roles and label/description attributes. It also appears to support ARIA equivalents for the other limited set of native HTML features it supports. For example, it recognises role=button as a button control. Advice for Web Developers There is nothing special you need to do to support ZoomText Web Finder apart from that which you should already be doing: marking up your UI using the semantics provided in the HTML5 standard and if you must roll your own UI, use ARIA to supplement the role, state and property information. If you don’t use HTML/ARIA to correctly convey UI semantics then ZoomText users will encounter a lot of this:       Do WAI-ARIA – Google Is!  Posted on Thursday, 7 August 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIA   There a bunch of interesting posts on Marco’s blog about WAI-ARIA: The first one ARIA in Gmail #1: Alerts is about the use of the WAI-ARIA role=\"alert\" and its use in Gmail. ARIA in Gmail #2: Enhancing the Chat experience describes the use of aria-activedescendant and Live Regions in Gmail, with details of Screen Reader and Browser support. You can also watch Google people, Charles Chen and TV Raman talk about Enhancing Web 2.0 Accessibility using the AxsJAX Framework for ARIA. Meanwhile Yahoo developers are cooking up more YUI-ARIA widgets, which you can read about on the YUI blog: Enhancing TabView Accessibility with WAI-ARIA Roles and States. Another Marco has been experimenting with adding WAI-ARIA to the YUI Accordian widget. And don’t forget Gez Lemons’ recently published Introduction to WAI ARIA.

Using WAI ARIA Landmark Roles – updated  Posted on Friday, 15 October 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Refer to Using WAI-ARIA Landmarks – 2013 Ukranian translation of Using WAI-ARIA Landmarks 2011 by Vlad Brown.  HTML5 and the myth of WAI-ARIA redundance  Posted on Thursday, 8 April 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Will HTML5 make the use of WAI-ARIA in HTML redundant? the short answer is definitley not. There are many ARIA roles and properties that are not provided by native elements and attributes in HTML5.  Also developers still  have the desire to roll their own interactive controls  even though they have been available in HTML as native elements for 11 years, why would this suddenly change when HTML5 arrives?  Examples: a button and a link Developers have had for 11 years number of native elements they can use for buttons and the a element for links, provided in HTML 4, all of which provide built in mouse and keyboard interaction and convey role, state and name properties to accessibilityAPIs:  input type=\"button\" input type=\"image\" button element a element  But still in 2010 companies like Google, choose to emulate a button with code (not to mention the associated scripting) such as this:  <DIV id=:rk class=\"J-K-I J-J5-Ji L3 J-K-I-JO\" tabIndex=0 unselectable=\"on\" closure_hashCode_l16mgm=\"182\" act=\"\"> <DIV class=\"J-J5-Ji J-K-I-Kv-H\" unselectable=\"on\"> <DIV class=\"J-J5-Ji J-K-I-J6-H\" unselectable=\"on\"> <DIV class=J-K-I-KC unselectable=\"on\"> <DIV class=J-K-I-K9-KP unselectable=\"on\">&nbsp;</DIV> <DIV class=J-K-I-Jz unselectable=\"on\">Search Mail</DIV> </DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV> and a link like this:  <SPAN id=:rg class=toxOdd role=link tabIndex=0 closure_hashCode_l16mgm=\"177\"> Create a filter</SPAN> Note: Examples are taken from Googles Gmail application. The reason is probably because they cannot apply the styles they want to native interactive elements, but who knows? What is important for accessibility is if developers choose to code in this way, they now have a method to provide the needed accessibility information. It would be preferable that they used the available native HTML elements, but if they do not, then ARIA provides what HTML alone cannot.

Aria roles and properties not available in HTML5 Below are listed the ARIA roles and properties. Those roles and properties suffixed with a “+”  are features not considered to be available natively in HTML5. It is clear that many roles and properties provided by ARIA which can be used to convey information to users are not available in HTML5. ARIA Roles 5.3.2. Widget Roles The following roles act as user interface widgets that do not provide a defined structure. All roles are linked to their definitions in the WAI-ARIA 1.0 specification.  alert + alertdialog + button checkbox combobox dialog + gridcell + link log + marquee + menuitem menuitemcheckbox menuitemradio option progressbar radio radiogroup scrollbar + slider spinbutton status + tab + tabpanel + textbox timer + tooltip + treeitem +  The following roles act as composite user interface widgets that provide a defined structure. These roles typically act as containers that manage other, contained widgets.  grid + listbox menu menubar tablist + toolbar tree + treegrid +  5.3.3. Document Structure The following roles describe structures that organize content in a page. Document structures are not usually interactive.  article columnheader definition + directory + document + group + heading img list listitem math + note + presentation + region + row rowheader separator  5.3.4. Landmark Roles The following roles are regions of the page intended as navigational landmarks.  application + banner + complementary contentinfo + form main + navigation search +  ARIA States and Properties (all aria-* attributes) Below is an alphabetical list of WAI-ARIA states and properties to be used by rich internet application authors. A detailed definition of each WAI-ARIA state and property follows this compact list.   aria-activedescendant + Identifies the currently active descendant of a composite widget. aria-atomic + Indicates whether assistive technologies will present all, or only parts of, the changed region based on the change notifications defined by the aria-relevant attribute. Also see aria-relevant. aria-autocomplete Indicates whether user input completion suggestions are provided. aria-busy (state) + Indicates whether an element, and its subtree, are currently being updated. aria-checked (state) Indicates the current “checked” state of checkboxes, radio buttons, and other widgets. Also see aria-pressed and aria-selected. aria-controls + Identifies the element (or elements) whose contents or presence are controlled by the current element. Also see aria-owns. aria-describedby + Identifies the element (or elements) that describes the object. Also see aria-labelledby. aria-disabled (state) Indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable. Also see aria-hidden and aria-readonly. aria-dropeffect + Indicates what functions can be performed when the dragged object is released on the drop target. This allows assistive technologies to convey the possible drag options available to users, including whether a pop-up menu of choices is provided by the application. Typically, drop effect functions can only be provided once an object has been grabbed for a drag operation as the drop effect functions available are dependent on the object being dragged. aria-expanded (state) + Indicates whether an expandable/collapsible group of elements is currently expanded or collapsed. aria-flowto + Identifies the next element (or elements) in the recommended reading order of content, overriding the general default to read in document source order. aria-grabbed (state) + Indicates an element’s “grabbed” state in a drag-and-drop operation. aria-haspopup + Indicates that the element has a popup context menu or sub-level menu. aria-hidden (state) Indicates that the element is not visible or perceivable to any user. Also see aria-disabled. aria-invalid (state) Indicates the entered value does not conform to the format expected by the application. aria-label + Defines a string value that labels the current element when included as an attribute of the current element. Also see aria-labelledby. aria-labelledby + Identifies the element (or elements) that labels the current element. Also see aria-label and aria-describedby. aria-level + Defines the hierarchical level of an element within a structure. aria-live + Indicates that an element will be updated, and describes the types of updates the user agents, assistive technologies, and user can expect from the live region. aria-multiline Indicates whether a text box accepts only a single line, or if it can accept multiline input. aria-multiselectable Indicates that the user may select more than one item from the current selectable descendants. aria-orientation + Indicates whether the element and orientation is horizontal or vertical. aria-owns + Identifies an element (or elements) in order to define a visual, functional, or contextual parent/child relationship between DOM elements where the DOM hierarchy cannot be used to represent the relationship. Also see aria-controls. aria-posinset + Defines an element’s number or position in the current set of listitems or treeitems. Not required if all elements in the set are present in the DOM. Also see aria-setsize. aria-pressed (state) + Indicates the current “pressed” state of toggle buttons. Also see aria-checked and aria-selected. aria-readonly Indicates that the element is not editable, but is otherwise operable. Also see aria-disabled. aria-relevant + Indicates what user agent change notifications (additions, removals, etc.) assistive technologies will monitor within a live region. Also see aria-atomic. aria-required Indicates that user input is required on the element before a form may be submitted. aria-selected (state) Indicates the current “selected” state of various widgets. Also see aria-checked and aria-pressed. aria-setsize + Defines the number of items in the current set of listitems or treeitems. Not required if all elements in the set are present in the DOM. Also see aria-posinset. aria-sort + Indicates if items in a table or grid are sorted in ascending or descending order. aria-valuemax Defines the maximum allowed value for a range widget. aria-valuemin Defines the minimum allowed value for a range widget. aria-valuenow Defines the current value for a range widget. Also see aria-valuetext. aria-valuetext Defines the human readable text alternative of aria-valuenow for a range widget.

Short note on what CSS display properties do to table semantics  Posted on Sunday, 4 March 2018 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: StandardsCategory: Testing   The CSS display properties are powerful. You can change the visual display of elements to match your desired styling, but sometimes doing this can have an unintended effect of nuking the semantics of the elements, as conveyed to screen reading software, in the browser accessibility tree. Screen readers and other assistive tech, in general, do not have direct access to the HTML DOM, they are provided access to a subset of information in the HTML DOM via Accessibility APIs. Sometimes what an element represents in the HTML DOM is not how it is represented in the accessibility tree.  If what is represented in the accessibility tree does not represent the developer’s intended UI, it’s either (wittingly/unwittingly) the fault of the developer or the browser. But what we can be sure of, in these cases, is that it is not the fault of the screen reader. An example the good A data table with default display properties is represented in the browser accessibility tree with each element’s semantics correctly conveyed:  Each element is represented in the accessibility tree with its appropriate role, for example a table element has a role=table.  the bad When CSS display:block or display:grid or display:flex is set on the table element, bad things happen. The table is no longer represented as a table in the accessibility tree, row elements/semantics are no longer represented in any form.  None of the elements are represented in the accessibility tree with data table semantics, they are all given a role=text frame.  This can be fixed by the developer by adding the semantics back using the ARIA table/row/columnheader/rowheader/cell roles (see the ARIA table design pattern) which is a lot of heavy lifting for the developer that should not be needed. In this case the browser should not be messing with the table semantics. If nothing else, a developer should be aware that it is not always the fault of the assistive technology when we can’t have nice things.

But when ARIA is hard-coded into HTML it can have unintended consequences if/when the JavaScript fails to deliver the expected functionality.  We use ARIA to provide or change the semantic information for HTML elements. This is almost always done to make an interactive component more accessible to screen reader users, and more often than not that interactivity is dependent on Javascript. An example is a link that has been repurposed to be a button. Ignoring the fact this is a lousy design pattern to use in the first place, it’s surprisingly common out in the wild. <a href=\"#disclosure\" class=\"button\" role=\"button\">Additional information</a> There is an important difference between a link and a button: a link can be activated using the enter key, and a button can be activated using the enter or space key. When you repurpose a link to be a button, the additional keyboard support must be provided using JavaScript. If the button role is hard-coded into the HTML, and the JavaScript fails for any reason, a screen reader user is left with the impression that they’re dealing with a button, but if they use the space key to activate it, nothing will happen. Another example is a static table that has sortable functionality added using JavaScript. We use various ARIA attributes to inform screen reader users about the role and state of the controls that allow the table data to be sorted, and provide the sort functionality using JavaScript. <table>\\r <tr>\\r <th aria-sort=\"none\"><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">First name</span></th>\\r <th aria-sort=\"none\"><span role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Last name</span></th>\\r ...\\r </tr>\\r ...\\r </table> As before, if the ARIA is hard-coded and the JavaScript fails, a screen reader user is left with the impression that they’re dealing with a sortable table that is broken. They will think there are buttons at the top of each column and that data is currently sorted in a particular order, yet when they try to sort the table, nothing will happen. It’s worth mentioning at this point, that accessibility is no longer a common reason for JavaScript to be unavailable. It used to be that Assistive Technologies (AT) like screen readers struggled to cope with JavaScript, and so AT users chose to disable it by choice. The 2009 WebAIM Screen Reader Users survey found that 10% of people disabled JavaScript in their browser, but by the 2014 Screen Reader users survey (the last time the question was included), the number had fallen to just 2%. The fact is that everyone is vulnerable to JavaScript failing. As Ian Feather of Buzzfeed noted in his DeltaV talk on Frontend Resilience, 1% of JavaScript requests to the Buzzfeed website fail every month. That’s 13 million requests (a greater proportion of page views than IE11). JavaScript fails for all of us at some point or another, for many different reasons, and Stuart Langridge’s Everyone has JavaScript, Right? explains many of those reasons. The W3C Note on Using ARIA has more detail, but it comes down to this: if you use JavaScript to provide functionality and/or any form of interaction, then the ARIA should be applied progressively (using JavaScript) too. In other words, let the accessibility degrade as gracefully as the rest of your code.  Short note on aria-labelledby and aria-describedby  Posted on Tuesday, 12 May 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIA   The ARIA attributes aria-labelledby and aria-describedby can be used to provide an accessible name or accessible description for a subset of HTML elements. It is important to note that by design, hiding the content (using CSS display:none or visibility:hidden or the HTML hidden attribute) of the element(s) referenced by these attributes does not stop the content from being used to provide the name/description. Hidden or visible – makes no difference By default, assistive technologies do not relay hidden information, but an author can explicitly override that and include hidden text as part of the accessible name or accessible description by using aria-labelledby or aria-describedby. – Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1 In the following example the description will be available to assistive technology users in both states: Non error state: message not visible <label>Name <input type=\"text\"  aria-describedby=\"error-message\"></label> <span id=\"error-message\" style=\"display:none\"> You have provided an incorrect name</span> Note: addition of aria-hidden=true to the referenced element makes no difference: <span id=\"error-message\" style=\"display:none\" aria-hidden=\"true\">  You have provided an incorrect name</span> Error state: message visible <span id=\"error-message\" style=\"display:inline\"> You have provided an incorrect name</span> Methods to provide context sensitive name/description text If you want to associate context sensitive text, such as an error message you can:  Add the referenced element to the DOM when the error state occurs. Add the error text as child of the referenced element in the DOM when the error state occurs.  non error state: <p id=\"error1\"></p> error state: <p id=\"error1\">incorrect mallory!</p>   Add the id reference in the DOM to the aria-labelledby/aria-describedby attribute, when the error state occurs.

This means that you can check your (X)HTML files containing ARIA attributes without them being flagged as errors. You can also check whether ARIA attributes and attribute values used are correct. Download the Validator SAC for MAC OSX with Experimental WAI-ARIA Support Validator SAC Beta (9mb dmg file) Checking a document with the experimental ARIA DTD’s using Validator SAC  On the validator inteface press the ‘More Options’ button.  Select a (X)HTML + ARIA DTD to check your document against from the ‘Document Type’ dropdown list. The ARIA DTD’s are located at the end of the dropdown list. Notes: The (X)THML + ARIA validation is based on attributes and attribute values as defined in the WAI-ARIA (draft) specification 1.0 . The DTD’s are not official versions and have not been endorsed by anyone. Validation of HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 documents using the experimental DTD’s, will detect errors in WAI-ARIA attribute names and values only. The DTD’s allow ARIA attributes to be placed on any element. It will not provide any indication of the correctness of the use of a WAI-ARIA attribute on any given element.  HTML5 Accessibility Chops: ARIA & validation  Posted on Thursday, 2 June 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   I tweeted the other day, suggesting people switch to the HTML5 doctype as the use of ARIA is conforming in HTML5. As things stand, if ARIA roles, states and properties are used on HTML elements with a doctype other than <!DOCTYPE html> a developer will get unhelpful error messages when using an HTML validator simply because the DOCTYPE they are using does not recognise ARIA attributes as valid. This is not likely to change. So make the switch!  FUD error messages Using ARIA with any flavour of HTML works equally well. It does not make one iota of difference to ARIA support in browsers or assistive technology, whether you use: this HTML 4.01 doctype  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\">  or this XHTML 1.0 strict doctype  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\"> or this HTML5 doctype <!DOCTYPE html> at the top of your <html lang=\"en\"> file. What using a DOCTYPE other than the HTML5 doctype will do is cause you much pain and consternation if you run your code through the W3C HTML validator, as you will get an error reported for each use of an ARIA attribute. You will not be told whether your use of the ARIA attribute in a given context is correct or whether the value you are using for a particular attribute is incorrect, you will only be told that it is an error… pretty useless. The following are both reported as errors when checked against HTML 4, not helpful since one is not a specified  role value and the other is. <div role=\"dribble\">  <div role=\"main\"> The HTML 4.0 error message: there is no attribute “ROLE” Now if the HTML5 doctype is used the results are much more useful: Bad value dribble for attribute role on element div. If a developer is using ARIA to improve the accessibility of the HTML content and interaction she wants to know whether she is using ARIA in a way which works, not that, due to the archane rules of doctypes, she is not allowed to use it. Work in progress Be aware that none of the available HTML5 conformance checkers have a fully implemented or up to date set of ARIA conformance rules, so you may get some funky results. If you do Please report any bugs you find. Like much of HTML5, the implementation of conformance checking is a work in progress and there is still much to do. This work is being done by Henri Sivonen and Mike tm Smith, their collective efforts can be tested on the Nu Markup Validation Service. Sting in the tail If you use attributes such as summary or longdesc, while these are valid in HTML <5 and XHTML , they are currently obsoleted in HTML5, For example, if you have an image such as this: <img src=\"bit.jpg\" alt=\"poot\" longdesc=\"pooter\"> you will get an unhelpful error message, rather than being informed that the longdesc value is incorrect as it needs to be an URL: The longdesc attribute on the img element is obsolete. Use a regular a element to link to the description. Like ARIA attributes in HTML 4, obsoleted attributes still work in browsers and AT when using the HTML5 doctype, you just get told not to use them, rather than whether you are using them so they will work.  Screen reader support for ARIA live regions  Posted on Monday, 17 March 2014 by Léonie Watson  Category: Strategy   An ARIA live region is a simple mechanism for notifying screen readers when content is updated on the page. Despite the obvious Accessible User Experience (AUX) benefits that live regions bring, screen reader support is disappointingly inconsistent.  To recap: A screen reader can only focus on one part of the page at a time. If something changes elsewhere on the page, there’s a good chance a screen reader user will be oblivious to it. When the update takes place within an ARIA live region, a screen reader is automatically notified (wherever its focus is at the time), and it conveys the updated content to the user. aria-live attribute The aria-live attribute identifies an element as a live region. It takes three possible values:  Off (no notification). Polite (screen reader notifies user once current task is complete). Assertive (screen reader interrupts current task to notify user).  aria-live test case  <head> ... <script>  var result1 = 0;  function update1() { \\tresult1 = result1 + 1; \\tdocument.getElementById(\"result1\").innerHTML=result1; } </script> </head>  <body> ... <div id=\"result1\" aria-live=\"polite\"></div>  <div> <button onclick=\"update1();\">Update result 1</button> </div> ... </body>  Browser support for aria-live Browser support for the aria-live attribute is good. All three of the browsers commonly used by screen reader users (Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari) expose ARIA live regions through their accessibility APIs. Screen reader support for aria-live Screen reader support is mixed at best, even when using a simple test case like the one above. For the common use case of triggering a live region update based on activation of a standard control, Jaws 15 fully supports the ARIA live region in both Firefox 27 and Internet Explorer 11. NVDA 2014.1 supports the aria-live attribute in Firefox, but not Internet Explorer. Window Eyes 8.4 only supports the ARIA live region in Firefox when the aria-live attribute is set to assertive. It doesn’t support it in Internet Explorer. VoiceOver in Safari 7.0.2 (OSX) fully supports the ARIA live region, but in Safari 7.0 (iOS) the test case only worked when the live region was assertive. status role The status role indicates that the element contains advisory information that the user should be made aware of, but which isn’t important enough to warrant an alert. The status role is a form of live region, so an element with the status role applied should not receive focus. status role test case  <head> ... <script>  var result1 = 0;  function update1() { \\tresult1 = result1 + 1; \\tdocument.getElementById(\"result1\").innerHTML=result1; } </script> </head>  <body> ... <div id=\"result1\" role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\"></div>  <div> <button onclick=\"update1();\">Update result 1</button> </div> ... </body> Browser support for status role Browser support for the status role is also good, with Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari all exposing ARIA live regions through their accessibility APIs. Screen reader support with status role From the screen reader point of view, adding the status role forces Window Eyes to recognise the polite ARIA live region in Firefox. However it doesn’t make any difference to VoiceOver in Safari (iOS), or Window Eyes or NVDA in Internet Explorer. With these simple test cases, the most widely supported combination is to use aria-live=”assertive” with role=”status” to create the ARIA live region. The only two browser/screen reader combinations that remain unsupportive are NVDA and Window Eyes in Internet Explorer. A word or two of caution though:  An assertive ARIA live region isn’t always desireable. Remember the notification will interrupt the screen reader from its current task, so use aria-live=”assertive” with care. The test cases used here are extraordinarily simple. When ARIA live regions are used in the wild (in more complex scenarios), screen reader behaviour is known to become more erratic.   Introduction to WAI ARIA – Gez Lemon  Posted on Thursday, 31 July 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIA   Gez Lemon from TPG has written an article for Dev.Opera, which provides an Introduction to WAI ARIA. WAI–ARIA is a specification that provides a means of describing roles, states, and properties for custom widgets so that they are recognisable and usable by assistive technology users. WAI-ARIA also provides a mechanism to ensure that users of assistive technologies are aware of updates in the application. This article provides an overview of what web applications should do, and how WAI-ARIA helps.  Short note on aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby  Posted on Wednesday, 12 July 2017 by Léonie Watson  Category: Development   Be careful when you use the aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby attributes, because they do not work consistently with all HTML elements. This is a short note on when (and when not) to use those attributes.  The aria-label and aria-labelledby attributes can be used to give an element an accessible name. The aria-describedby attribute can be used to give an element an accessible description. Not all elements can be given an accessible name and/or description though. The aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby attributes can be used with:  interactive elements like a (when the href attribute is present), audio and video (when the controls attribute is present), input (unless they are of type=\"hidden\"), select, button, and textarea elements that have a landmark role – either implicit (header, footer, main, nav, aside, section, and form) or explicitly set via the role attribute elements that have an explicit widget role applied using the role attribute – there are 27 widget roles in ARIA 1.1, including dialog, slider, progressbar, and tooltip iframe and img elements  If you use aria-label, aria-labelledby, or aria-describedby with any other elements (like div, span, p, blockquote, or strong etc.), they generally won’t work across all browser/assistive technology combinations. For more information on this, and on using ARIA with HTML in general, refer to the W3C Note on Using ARIA.  Apple Webkit Gets Serious About WAI-ARIA (on Mac)  Posted on Monday, 28 September 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   A check of the support for WAI-ARIA roles in the latest Webkit Nightly builds, reveals a major improvement for WAI-ARIA role support on the Mac version of Webkit (an open source web browser engine), but the Windows version shows little progress.  Mac Webkit nightly builds now support more than 60% of the ARIA roles, up from 25% a few months ago. Improved support includes all ARIA landmark roles and many document structure roles. WAI-ARIA has 59 possible role values (excluding abstract roles): Mac Support  Webkit Nightly 26/09/09 on Mac exposes 39 role values correctly via The Mac accessibility API. Safari 4.0 on Mac exposes 17 role values correctly via The Mac accessibility API Safari 4 Beta on Mac exposes 15 role values correctly via The Mac accessibility API  Windows Support  Webkit Nightly 23/09/09 on Windows exposes 10 role values correctly via MSAA. Safari 4.0 on Windows exposes 8 role values via MSAA Safari 4 Beta on Windows exposes 8 role values via MSAA  Detailed results: ARIA role tests on Mac and Windows – Webkit Nightly builds, Safari 4.0 & Safari 4 beta.  HTML5 Accessibility Chops: ARIA landmark support  Posted on Monday, 11 July 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The ARIA landmark roles can be used in HTML5 to markup regions of a page. Landmark roles add a new means to navigate page content for users of supporting assistive technology. They can be used on semantically neutral elements such as the div element or they can be added, to HTML5 elements that have  implied semantics such as header or footer, to fill in current gaps in accessibility support.  ARIA Landmark usage ARIA landmarks are present on many popular sites, for example:  Google search BBC Yahoo!  Landmark Role Current Support ARIA landmark roles are currently supported by:  NVDA and JAWS when using Internet Explorer 9 or Firefox 3+. VoiceOver when using Safari on iOS 4+ Orca (Linux screen reader) using Firefox 3+ supports landmarks (not tested).  Detailed results of testing for JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver and Window eyes What does supported mean? Users can navigate page content using ARIA landmarks For JAWS 10-12 landmark keyboard navigation in virtual mode is:   next landmark ; (semi-colon) previous landmark SHIFT + ; (semi-colon) list landmarks CTRL + INS + ; (semi-colon   For NVDA 2011.2 the landmark keyboard combination in virtual buffer mode is:  next landmark D previoius landmark shift + D list landmarks (and list/headings) NVDA + F7   VoiceOver users can navigate a page via landmarks (if present), by choosing ‘landmarks’ in the ‘web rotor’, then finger flicking up or down will move to the next or previous landmark.  Important Note on role=application: When navigated to, role=application causes some screen readers to change modes. Therefore application role must only be used on interactive content for which the application mode is appropriate. It is to be used with extreme caution! The article JAWS support for ARIA is a must read for understanding how JAWS modes work and how JAWS interacts with role=application. Also worth reading When should you use ARIA role=”application”? and Not All ARIA Widgets Deserve role=\"application\". Addendum: Roger johannson reports that VoiceOver on OSX 10.7 Lion now supports ARIA landmarks: VoiceOver now lets you use ARIA landmarks, if they are present, to  navigate web pages. If Quick Nav is active you can use the w and W keys  to navigate to the next or previous landmark. When you use the arrow  keys to navigate around a page, VoiceOver announces when you enter and  leave landmarks, including the type of landmark (for example “Leaving  main landmark, entering complementary landmark”).

The results were not encouraging. Fast forward to yesterday, while in a discussion with my TPG colleague Jonny ‘Bonny’ James I had cause to revisit the alert tests and consequently retested alert support using some of the latest screen reader and browser combinations. The original research considered four different methods for coding role=alert messages and how well each was supported. These same 4 methods were tested again.  The four methods tested  createElement(), insertAttribute(), createTextNode() and appendchild() innerHTML display:none to display:block, display:inline etc. createTextNode + constraints  Refer to original article for details The results  Support for ARIA alert across selected browsers/screen readers/OS combinations           NVDA + Windows 1, 2, 3 ,4 =  1, 2, 3 =  1, 2 =  1, 2, 3, 4 =     JAWS + Windows 1, 2, 3 ,4 =  1, 2, 3 ,4 =  1, 2, 3 ,4 =      VoiceOver + macOS 1, 2, 3 ,4 =     1, 2, 3 ,4 =    VoiceOver + iOS 1, 2, 3 ,4 =  1, 2, 3 ,4 =    1, 2, 3 ,4 =    Narrator + Windows   3, 4 =  3, 4 =      Note: tested using latest versions of the browser/screen reader/OS. Combinations that are known not to work together for general HTML content access were not tested. \\u200bAnalysis Support has improved considerably since the last round of tests in 2012. Methods 1, 2 and 3 are robustly supported by NVDA (1 and 2 only with IE), JAWS and VoiceOver. NVDA and JAWS with Edge are still not practical combinations. And unfortunately Narrator currently does not have the robust support one would expect when used with IE and Edge.  Short Note on ARIA, Dragon and Standards  Posted on Tuesday, 19 November 2013 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIA   There has been ongoing discussion, mainly on twitter, about Dragon naturally speaking, ARIA and Accessibility APIs. A recent tweet informs these notes. #dragon doesn’t support #aria & according to @ewaccess, it probably never will. It’s definitely an AT solution nonetheless. #a11yCampTO — Denis Boudreau (@dboudreau) November 16, 2013  Accessibility is a  social contract Accessibility advocates ask developers and browser vendors to do their part to make HTML content accessible. A technological framework for this is provided via web standards including: HTML, WAI-ARIA and WCAG. If Assistive Technology vendors do not work with developers and browser vendors by making use of the information provided through standardized interfaces for making HTML content accessible, it’s the user that gets screwed, but not by the developer or the browser vendor as they are fulfilling their part of the social contract. A Misunderstanding of ARIA ARIA is a tool that allows developers to represent the role, states and properties of HTML content in accessibility APIs. It is the job of browser to support the connections between an ARIA attribute and it’s representation in an accessibility API (and browsers implementers have stepped up). It is the job of the developer to add the ARIA attributes (and scripted behaviour) to HTML when they build custom controls. It is the job of an assistive technology to make use of these standard platform accessibility APIs to convey information about content to users. The three parties involved: developer, browser and assistive tech all have a responsibility. If developers and browsers fulfill their responsibilities by coding and exposing the information according to web standards, it is incumbent on the assistive technology to make use of this information, otherwise their users suffer. (added 21/11/2013) Requirements on applications as per the Section 508 refresh (503.3 is relevant to Dragon): 503.3 Alternative User Interfaces.  Where an application provides an alternative user interface that functions as assistive technology, the application shall use platform and other industry standard accessibility services to provide the alternate user interface. [emphasis mine] Further reading: Notes on Guidelines For Speech accessible HTML for Dragon NaturallySpeaking  What ARIA does not do  Posted on Wednesday, 13 August 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   ARIA is a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements (and other markup languages) to communicate accessibility role, state, name and properties which are exposed by browsers via platform accessibility APIs. This provides a common, interoperable method of relaying the information to assistive technologies. That’s it. It is the same method used by browsers to convey the inbuilt (or default) accessibility information of native HTML features. The difference being that authors can wire up this information for themselves in the DOM using ARIA, before they could not.  A simple example of what ARIA does and does not do: ARIA does not magically make any element act differently to what it is,  it only provides a method to make it appear as something else to assistive technology users. For example, in the sample code below, the ARIA role attribute makes the  <div> appear as a link to  assistive technology. Developers must provide the substance to the semantics conveyed using ARIA, otherwise users are confronted with a UI masquerade. <div role=\"link\">poot</div> versus <a href=\"...\">poot</a>     feature role=”link” <a href=”…”>   conveys role to accessibility API     conveys accessible name to accessibility API     keyboard support (focus)     keyboard support (operation)     element specific context menu     default visual semantics (e.g. underlining)         aria-labelledby and aria-describedby support in popular Windows browsers  Posted on Tuesday, 10 June 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Back in 2010 I filed a bug on Internet Explorer about its lack of support for exposing the calculated values of aria-labelledby and aria-describedby in the MSAA accessibility API. After some back and forth a partial fix was implemented. Partial Fix The upshot was that IE would correctly convey the name and description for an element if the elements referenced by the aria-labelledby and aria-describedby attributes were what IE classed as accessible HTML elements. Notes from IE team on IE’s partial fix (below) for details. Note: Despite IE’s limited support, screen readers may still support labelledby and describedby in IE, depending on whether they have implemented their own workarounds. Workarounds (added burdens) Since 2010’s IE implementation I have been advocating the use of a number of methods to work around the limitation in IE’s implementation. Use of tabdindex=”-1″ This is the Microsoft documented method: You can make non-accessible elements accessible by specifying a value for the element’s TABINDEX attribute. Example: <p tabindex=\"-1\" id=\"label-1\">label text</p> ... <input type=\"text\" aria-labelledby=\"label-1\"> Use of the <label> element The <label> element works (although not listed as an accessible element) and usually descriptions associated with controls are extended labels Example: <input type=\"text\" aria-describedby=\"desc-1\"> ... <label id=\"desc-1\">instructions</label> Of late I have dropped the <label> element advocacy as it was viewed as a misuse of <label> by some in the web standards community. Where are we at in 2014? Following a recent discussion I have tested support in popular modern browsers on Windows Summary  Firefox 29 supports aria-labelledby and aria-describedby with single or multiple id references. Chrome 35 supports aria-labelledby and aria-describedby with single or multiple id references. IE 11 does not support aria-labelledby or aria-describedby with single or multiple id references unless the referenced element is what Microsft classes as an accessible element. IE non accessible elements can be made into accessible elements by the addition of tabindex=\"-1\" as documented or via the addition of an ARIA role (when appropriate).  A new Internet Explorer bug has been filed Notes from IE team on IE’s partial fix (2010) This is the text from the response by the IE team to the bug I filed (note: actual bug is no longer available) As we evaluated this bug report and the repro page, we found that the test cases failed because of three different issues: 1.When presented with multiple labeledby and describedBy elements IE did not concatenate the values from those elements into the MSAA name or description. 2.When an element contained a native accessibility attribute (title or alt) the aria-labeledBy and describedBy attributes did not take precedence over the native attributes. 3.The value of the elements pointed at by the aria-labeledby and describedby is only available to the accessibility properties if the elements themselves are accessible objects.  Not all IE elements are accessible objects as is described here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms528445(v=VS.85).aspx#acc_elements (*Note – I have asked Cullen to check this documentation as I’m not sure how accurate it is but it was the best I could find.  It doesn’t mention that adding an aria-role to an element also makes it accessible.) We fixed the first two issues. IE9 will now concatenate the value of multiple labeledby/describedby elements and use labeledby/described by to trump native accessibility attributes if the labeledby/describedby elements are accessible objects.  The list of elements which are automatically accessible objects is here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms528445(v=VS.85).aspx#acc_elements and you can easily make any other element an accessible object by adding a tabindex or an aria role to it.   While we investigated fixes for the third issue, it will not be resolved in IE9.  However, we will revisit this in the future.  Since the test page requires all three issues to be fixed, you won’t see the expected behavior on that page.  The workaround is to add a role=’tooltip’ attribute on elements l1, l2, l3, d1 and d2 on the test page then you will see all the tests working. Regards, The Microsoft Connect Team.    Notes on accessibility of Microsoft.com’s new home page  Posted on Thursday, 4 October 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Microsoft.com has a new home page. It uses HTML5 and ARIA. I have done a quick review of their usage. There are a few issues…  home page accessibility – updated 05/02/13 language –  fixed 06/10/12 The UK home page has a lang=”de” on the HTML element. This results in the page being pronounced using the German language setting in JAWS and NVDA. Suggest they need to use the correct lang value: lang=”en” <html lang=\"en\"> search form –  not fixed 05/02/13 The search form has a pseudo list box which displays the search choices and seach term matches. It’s keyboard accessible via up/down arrow keys, but the presence of the list is not exposed to assistive technology, users will have no idea it is there. Suggest, using ARIA to provide correct role, name, state and property information. An example of a more usable autocomplete widget. Search dropdown list with search term and search scope options Use of ARIA roles to identify navigation links as a menu –  not fixed 05/02/13 Microsoft navigation links \\'security\\' menu Code snippet from the navgation links menu: <ul role=\"menu\" bi:parenttitle=\"t1\">  <li role=\"menuitem\"> <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx\" bi:index=\"0\" bi:cpid=\"hpMenu\">Security Home</a></li>  ...  </ul> First thought is, even if marked up correctly, it would be better not to identify the navigation links menu as a menu with menu items as they are a list of links in a web site not a menu in a web application. Adobe have also recently implemented a new navigation menu, it uses a hybrid keyboard interaction approach: tab and up/down arrow with minimal, but effective use of  ARIA to indicate the presence of sub menus to AT users and interaction hints for keyboard only users. It is suggested that Adobe’s approach is more fitting to the context in which it is used. The Microsoft menu bar does not work as it should. If interactive content is marked up as a menu bar with menus and menu items, its interaction behaviour should be that of a menu bar, it is not. The role information provided via ARIA indicates an expected and defined set of keyboard interactions. The ‘menu bar’ on the Microsoft home page has none of these. If you test it with a screen reader, you will find a few issues… Example of a menu bar widget that is suitable for a web application setting (in an embedded HTML editor, for example) and works as it should. Suggest implementing a navigation links menu that provides appropriate semantics and works for keyboard and AT users. ARIA landmark use –  not fixed 05/02/13 The Microsoft home page, makes use of the ARIA search, navigation and contentinfo landmark roles, but for some unknown reason does not provide a role=main… Suggest adding role=main. <div class=\"grid-container\" role=\"main\"> ... </div> HTML5 use Uses the HTML5 doctype, section, header and footer elements and input type=search. These have minimal effect on accessibility as support for these elements is somewhat limited. The positive effect of using the HTML5 doctype is that when validating the HTML code ARIA use is not flagged as an error (maybe in this case it should be). Conclusion Surprised that user testing was not conducted, or if it was… Come on Microsoft you can do better. Note that this is no way an exhaustive list of issues.  ARIA Slider, Part 1  Posted on Thursday, 29 May 2008 by Hans Hillen  Category: Development Tag: ARIATag: JAWSTag: NVDA   Starting with Steve’s article ARIA Toggle Button and Tri-state Checkbox examples, we will be providing more examples about how to use ARIA roles and states in practice. As Steve mentioned, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is steadily gaining more support by all major browsers, now that Internet Explorer, Opera and Safari are all on board. Our aim is to demonstrate how simple adding ARIA can be. In this article, I will be providing an example for the slider role. Note: This post is the first in a series of three. Here I will cover the basic markup needed for adding ARIA information to a slider widget. The second post will focus on the additional accessibility factors to consider when creating sliders (such as focus, scalability, and progressive enhancement). Finally, the third post will demonstrate how to use two sliders to create double (ranged) sliders. A Basic ARIA Slider Example To see a working example of an ARIA slider, view the ARIA slider example. This example contains a simple mockup for a volume control slider widget, composed using a div element and a button element The slider value ranges from 0 to 100%. Note that this for the purpose of keeping the example simple and focused on ARIA, this slider’s functionality has been kept very basic. More detailed and complex examples will be provided in my next post. The rest of the current article will discuss the ARIA related features of the example. Applying a Role, and Where To make an element be interpreted as a slider by assistive technology, you need to add the ‘role’ attribute with a value of ‘slider’. So where do you have to apply this role? Sliders generally consist of two base components: the rail and the thumb. The user can change the slider’s value by dragging the thumb across the rail (or by using the keyboard to move it). However, as far as ARIA is concerned, you really only need one element to make a slider. This can be either the thumb element or the rail. The element you provide with the slider role is also the element that will need to be keyboard accessible (meaning that it must be part of the tab order and have key event handlers assigned to change the slider’s value). For example, if we choose to give the slider thumb the role attribute, you could mark it up using the following code: <div class=\"sliderRail\">  <button class=\"sliderThumb\" role=\"slider\"></button> </div> If we were to use the rail element, the role would be placed on the outer element instead. It is important to note that, in order to be keyboard accessible, only one element actually needs to be part of the tab order. To place both the thumb and the rail in the tab order would unnecessarily clutter it. In the following post I will discuss keyboard and focus related issues in more detail. labeling and Describing Like all form controls, sliders need to be identifiable by users. To label a slider, you can choose from the following approaches:  Use the ‘aria-labelledby‘ property to point to the ID of an element containing the slider’s name. Use the HTML ‘title’ attribute to specify the name. Use an HTML ‘label’ element, and have it’s ‘for’ attribute point to the slider element.  All approaches cause the text to be exposed to the assistive technology. However, since we’re not only targetting screen readers, it is always required to have a visual label adjacent to the control, which cannot be achieved using the ‘title’ attribute alone. One thing I have noted is that when using an image or image input element as a slider, its (required) ‘alt’ value will be incorrectly exposed as the slider’s name, regardless of specified ‘aria-labelledby’ or ‘title’ values. Also, IE8 beta 1 will incorrectly expose the image’s src attribute as the slider’s value, rather than the specified ‘aria-valuenow’ value. This unfortunately makes it harder to cater for users that are not ‘ARIA ready’, as you might want to use the alt attribute to specify additional information the users miss out on. For example, An image input control marked up as an ARIA slider could have the following alt text specified: “volume, 40 of 100%”. This text would then be read by screen readers and browsers not supporting ARIA, making the slider at least more readable. Since ARIA causes the ‘slider’ role to override the ‘push button’ role normally exposed by the image type input control, you would also expect the ‘alt’ value to be overriden by the chosen labeling method. States and Properties The following ARIA properties are required for a slider widget:  aria-valuenow The slider’s current value. aria-value-min The minimum of the value range aria-value-max The maximum of the value range  Additionally, you can use the ‘aria-value-text‘ property, which exposes a more human readable value to the assistive technology. For example, instead of simply setting a slider’s aria-valuenow property to 50, the aria-valuetext property could be ’50 dollars’. This property is also crucial for sliders that have non-numeric values, which will be discussed in my next post. As with all ARIA controls, you can specify the generic ‘aria-describedby‘ property to point to an element containing more detailed information, such as any constraints the slider might have. The code example below shows the complete ARIA slider markup: <p id=\"sliderDescription\">Use the arrow keys to change the value.</p> <div class=\"sliderRail\">       <button class=\"sliderThumb\" role=\"slider\" title=\"Volume\"  aria-describedby=\"sliderDescription\" aria-valuemin=\"0\"  aria-valuemax=\"100\" aria-valuenow=\"20\" aria-valuetext=\"20 percent\"> </button> </div> Support The slider role is currently properly exposed by Firefox 1.5 and higher as well as Internet Explorer 8 beta 1. The aria-valuetext properly is supported by Firefox 3. I have not been able to confirm whether the ARIA is supported in Opera 9.5 beta, so if someone can tell me more about this I would like to hear it. Below follows a list of commonly used assistive technology available for Windows:  JAWS versions 7.1 to 9.0 recognize the slider role and value change, but will incorrectly announce every value as a percentage (such as 800%). Also, when using the ‘aria-valuetext’ property, JAWS will only read the value if that value actually starts with a number. Otherwise it will simply announce 0%. For example setting aria-valuetext to “9am” will cause JAWS to announce “9 percent”, but an ‘aria-valuetext’ value of “morning” will not be recognized. Window Eyes 5.5 and 6.1 Correctly announce both the role and value change correctly, including values set with ‘aria-valuetext’. NVDA also correctly announces the role as well as the value when it is changed. Zoomtext 9.1 announces the slider as a ‘custom control’, but does perceive the specified value correctly. However, the value is only announced when the slider receives focus, not when the value actually changes. Also, Zoomtext does not announce descriptions set with ‘aria-describedby’.

Short note on ARIA support  Posted on Friday, 27 July 2018 by Léonie Watson  Category: Development    It is easy to get the idea that ARIA fixes everything for accessibility, but the reality is that ARIA serves a very specific purpose, for a very specific audience.  ARIA is only supported in browsers and screen readers. Actually, a tiny amount of ARIA is also supported in recent versions of Dragon, but not enough to make it a credible solution for speech recognition users. Browser support for ARIA depends on the accessibility Application Programming Interface (API) being used. Fortunately, there is good support for ARIA in all accessibility APIs. The Core Accessibility API Mappings (AAM) specification describes how each ARIA role and state should be implemented in the accessibility APIs. Of all the available Assistive Technologies (AT), only screen readers (Jaws, Narrator, NVDA, TalkBack, and VoiceOver) properly support ARIA. So to all intents and purposes, ARIA is a screen reader only solution. There is more information about the relationship between the accessibility API, browser, and AT, in What does accessibility supported mean? Documentation of screen reader support for ARIA is scarce. There is an effort to document Jaws support for ARIA (and other web standards), and PowerMapper publishes an ARIA screen reader compatibility table, but there is little else. This gap in our collective knowledge is a bigger problem than you might think. ARIA is not tested for screen reader support before the ARIA specification is published. The W3C requires that every feature in a specification, in this case every role, state and property, has at least two working implementations. The purpose of this requirement is to make sure that features are viable for use in the wild. The catch is that ARIA is tested for support in accessibility APIs, but not in screen readers. In other words, it is possible for a feature to be included in the ARIA specification because it has accessibility API support, but for it to have little or no practical support in screen readers. The description and term roles are two such examples. So test your ARIA implementation with screen readers before you deploy your code. Remember, the experience doesn’t have to be identical in every screen reader, but it does have to be usable in most.  What is an accessible name?  Posted on Tuesday, 11 April 2017 by Léonie Watson  Category: Development   Many HTML elements have an accessible name. It can be derived from different sources, and browsers use an algorithm called the Accessible Name and Description Computation to figure it out.  The accessible name for a HTML element is exposed in the browser’s accessibility tree. It is the piece of information used by Assistive Technologies (AT) to identify the element. For example, someone using a speech recognition tool can target the element using its accessible name, or someone using a screen reader will hear the accessible name announced as they moved focus to that element. The accessible name for an element can be derived from the element’s content, an attribute, or from an associated element. Using the element’s content The content of an <a> element gives the link its accessible name. The accessible name for the following link is “Chamukos tequila”. <a href=\"tequila.html\">Chamukos tequila</a> So someone using a speech recognition tool would say something like “Click chamukos tequila link”, and a screen reader would hear something like “Chamukos tequila link” when they move focus to it. Check out this screen reader demo to hear how an HTML link sounds. Using an attribute The accessible name for an image is derived from the alt attribute. The accessible name for the following image is “Chamukos tequila”. <img src=\"tequila.png\" alt=\"Chamukos tequila\"> These two sources for an accessible name can be combined. When an image is the only content of a link, the image’s alt attribute gives the link its accessible name. <a href=\"tequila.html\"><img src=\"tequila.png\" alt=\"Chamukos tequila\"></a> When a link contains both an image and some text, the two combine to form the link’s accessible name. The accessible name for the following link is “Chamukos tequila £40”. <a href=\"tequila.html\"><img src=\"tequila.png\" alt=\"Chamukos tequila\"> £40</a> Using an associated element The accessible name for a form control can be derived from an associated element. The accessible name for the following checkbox is “Chamukos tequila”. <input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"tequila\"> <label for=\"tequila\">Chamukos tequila</label> The for attribute on the <label> and the id attribute on the <input> share the same value. This creates an association between the two elements that instructs the browser to expose the content of the label as the accessible name for the checkbox. Using ARIA The accessible name for an element can be altered using ARIA. The aria-label and aria-labelledby attributes work in different ways, but the important thing to remember is that ARIA trumps all; the accessible name provided with the native HTML will be overridden by the accessible name provided with ARIA. With aria-label The aria-label attribute takes a string as its value. It can be used to provide an alternative accessible name for an element. <button aria-label=\"Add Chamukos tequila to cart\">Add to cart</button> The accessible name for this button is “Add Chamukos tequila to cart”, not “Add to cart” because the ARIA overrides the HTML.  This can seem like a good way to provide meaningful accessible names for screen reader users, whilst presenting a shorter label for the button to sighted people. The trouble is that someone using a speech recognition tool will not be able to see the accessible name for the button, only its visible label – which makes it difficult for them to accurately target the button using a voice command. If there is only one “Add to cart” button on the page, tools like Dragon Naturally Speaking will correctly target the button because it doesn’t need the complete accessible name to be spoken. But if there are multiple “Add to cart” buttons on the page, then Dragon will assign each one a number, and the person using speech recognition will have to specify which of the “Add to cart” buttons they want.  With aria-labelledby The aria-labelledby attribute takes an id ref as its value. It’s used when the text you want to use as an accessible name is located elsewhere on the page. <input type=\"search\" aria-labelledby=\"this\"> <button id=\"this\">Search</button> Choosing accessible names Choose accessible names with care. If there are two things on a page that do exactly the same thing, give them the same accessible name. For example, two links that point to the same destination should have the same accessible name. Conversely, if there are six buttons on a page that all do different things, each one should have an accessible name that is unique and distinct from the rest. Thanks to Eric Wright for help understanding Dragon behaviour.  HTML5 Accessibility Chops: Just use a (native HTML) button  Posted on Tuesday, 19 April 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   Many User interface widgets can be developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in some cases developers build custom versions of native HTML controls because they cannot achieve the exact look and feel or behaviour they desire with a native control.  Where ever possible it is recommended that native HTML controls be used over custom controls as their accessibility support is likely to be more robust and it’s much less work. However, if you do have a need to develop a custom control there are a number of steps you will have to take to ensure it is accessible. In HTML5 it is conforming to use ARIA to help in the creation of an accessible custom control. A standard button (input type=”button”)  code: <input type=\"button\" value=\"search\" onclick=\"alert(\\'submitted\\');\"> Example requirements for creating an accessible custom control Note: The following is a demonstration of the steps to create an accessible custom button. It is not recommended that:  a custom button is created using an image. a custom control be used instead of a native HTML control (unless accessibility support is not implemented for a particular control.) event attributes are added inline.  Starting with an image NOTE: the use of an image is for demonstrating the steps required to make a non interactive HTML element into an accessible interactive element. If you want to create an image based control use input type=image. The image below looks and acts like a button for mouse users who can see, you can click it and something happens and  it has a label. For other users there are problems:  it only has a visual label. it’s identified in the code as an image not a button. it cannot be used with the keyboard  it is not focusable it does not respond to the expected keys for activating a button     code: <img src=\"button.gif\" onclick=\"alert(\\'submitted\\');\"> 1. Adding an accessible label An accessible label can be added to the image using the alt attribute.  Code: <img src=\"button.gif\" alt=\"search\" onclick=\"alert(\\'submitted\\');\"> Reference: HTML5: Techniques for providing useful text alternatives 2. Adding a role to identify the control To provide the correct identity for the element so users of assistive technology are aware they are dealing with a user interface element that has the behaviour of a button, not an image the WAI-ARIA button role can be used. Note:adding a button role does not make the element operable as a button for assistive technology or keyboard users. It only identifies the element as a button and AT may provide some usage instructions. For example, when the element receives focus (see step 3.A. below) a screen reader such as JAWS will announce “search button, press spacebar to press.” Unless you add the required keyboard behaviour (step 4.B. below) it will not be usable!  Code: <img src=\"button.gif\" alt=\"search\" role=\"button\" onclick=\"alert(\\'submitted\\');\"> 3. A. Navigation via the keyboard To provide access to the control for  keyboard users, it must be focusable and in the tab order of the page. To do this tabindex with a value of “0” can be  added. This puts the element in the default tab order of the page.  Code: <img src=\"button.gif\" alt=\"search\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\"  onclick=\"alert(\\'submitted\\');\"> Reference: Using Tabindex to Manage Focus among Widgets (WAI-ARIA) 3. B. expected keyboard behaviour for buttons A native HTML button has 2 keys associated with it that will operate it: The enter key and the space. You will need to add scripting that listens for these keys being pressed and activates the custom button action.  Code: <img src=\"button.gif\" alt=\"search\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onkeypress=\"if(event.keyCode==32||event.keyCode==13){alert(\\'submitted\\')};\"  onclick=\"alert(\\'submitted\\');\"> Reference: Button design pattern (WAI-ARIA) Other considerations:  Ensuring other relevant control states and properties such as disabled are conveyed using WAI-ARIA Providing a clear indication of focus Providing custom controls that support windows high contrast mode (examples) General Steps for Building an Accessible Widget with WAI-ARIA   Testing ARIA User Input control’s navigation support.  Posted on Tuesday, 9 December 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: ARIATag: JAWSTag: NVDA   Assistive technology such as screen readers provide keyboard short cuts for navigating the content of web pages. For user input controls such as radio buttons and edit boxes the user can navigate the controls sequentially using assigned ‘form field’ or ‘form control’ navigation keys: JAWS commands  List of Form Fields = INSERT + F5 Move To Next Form Field = F Move To Prior Form Field = SHIFT + F  NVDA commands Navigate by form control = F Window Eyes commands  List controls = INS + TAB Next Control = C Previous Control = SHIFT + C  Form control lists JAWS and Window Eyes provide a list form controls feature, these lists contain all the elements on a page that are recognized as form controls. Users can select a control from the list and move focus and activate it (JAWS), or move focus to it or move focus and activate it (Window Eyes). So for example using JAWS, if a checkbox is chosen from the list and the OK button pressed, the checkbox will receive focus and its state will be changed.   Navigation Support for ARIA User Input control Roles For ARIA support in assistive technologies (AT) to be considered robust, navigation mechanisms provided in AT must also support ARIA based controls and other interface elements. Results of navigation support testing for JAWS, Window Eyes, and NVDA suggest that although ARIA Roles such as slider, listbox or spinbutton are recognized by some assistive technology, they are not included in control navigation features.

Indicates an element is being modified and that assistive technologies MAY want to wait until the modifications are complete before exposing them to the user. source: ARIA 1.1 – aria-busy It appears that currently only JAWS uses this information to hide busy content from the user (with Chrome and Firefox, not IE), other screen readers such as NVDA and VoiceOver ignore the busy state and the content can still be accessed. Try it for yourself: aria-busy test See the Pen aria-busy test by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.  Using aria-hidden to achieve the same outcome If you need/want to hide content from users for a set period of time, while content is updating, you can instead use aria-hidden. Its use results in the same outcome, but is much more robustly supported across browser and screen reader combinations.

JAWS Support for ARIA – updated October 2012  Posted on Thursday, 7 October 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Freedom scientific have provided documentation on how the JAWS screen reader supports WAI-ARIA. It is available as a microsoft word document. Below is the same information in HTML format   JAWS ARIA Support Preface Before discussing JAWS support for ARIA, it’s important to understand the relationship between the ARIA markup itself, the browser in which the markup is rendered, and JAWS as it provides spoken or Braille information to users. First, ARIA markup was designed to insert information useful to assistive technologies into existing HTML code. It exists as a way to label controls and to provide information about their states. But adding ARIA support to a Web page does not change the presentation or behavior of that Web page to sighted users. For example, adding the ARIA role of “checkbox” to a “div” tag within a Web page will produce no visible effect on the page. Instead, if there is a check box on the page which has been rendered without using the “input” tag, the ARIA role of “checkbox” can be added to the code to inform assistive technology users that a check box appears at that point on the page. Second, the browser plays a big role in interpreting ARIA markup. Most browsers support some type of accessibility API (application programming interface), and assistive technologies use the API to get information about what is presented on the screen. So, ARIA markup is transformed by the browser into information that fits the accessibility API it supports. Then, the information provided by the API is consumed by the assistive technology. That means JAWS support of ARIA depends heavily on the browser being used. Third, JAWS gathers information from the ARIA markup and the browser’s API and presents it in a meaningful way to screen reader users. Because of the above interactions, the quality of JAWS support for ARIA markup is inextricably tied to the careful, thorough application of ARIA markup on a Web page, and comprehensive support provided by the browser in which the markup is rendered. For best results, Freedom Scientific recommends that Web page authors read the ARIA best practices guide carefully before adding ARIA markup to their pages. Also, concepts such as roles, states, landmarks, and so on are defined as part of the ARIA specification, and are therefore not defined in this document. If you are unfamiliar with these concepts please read through the ARIA documentation before continuing. Note: For the reasons described above, there may be differences in JAWS ARIA support between IE and Firefox. Please test any examples in both browsers. And please specify which browser you’re using when reporting problems to Freedom Scientific. Concepts It’s a good idea to have a firm grasp of the following concepts. These items form the basis of many descriptions throughout the document. Virtual Cursor JAWS presents Web pages using the JAWS Virtual Cursor. This allows users to read and navigate a Web page as though it were a text document. Users press the arrow keys to read line by line, word by word, character by character, and so on. JAWS also provides quick navigation keys, which are alpha-numeric keys that move the Virtual Cursor to features of the page such as links, headings, and form controls. In addition, users can press the TAB key to move between focusable elements on the page. Using the arrow keys or quick nav keys to change the position of the Virtual Cursor does not change the actual focus point in the application. This means that even if JAWS reads the text of a given link on a Web page for example, that link doesn’t necessarily have the keyboard focus. Note: The keyboard focus is typically represented visually as a highlighted area surrounding a control. Conversely, pressing the TAB or SHIFT+TAB key to navigate moves the focus point and the Virtual Cursor follows the focus. Forms mode Because JAWS uses the arrow keys and alpha-numeric keys for Virtual Cursor navigation, these keyboard commands are not passed through to interactive controls (form fields) on the page. This approach has the added benefit of protecting users from inadvertently changing form field values or activating controls on the page while simply reviewing the content. Forms mode is when JAWS turns over processing of the above keys to form controls so that users can interact with them. For example, when using the Virtual Cursor, pressing the letter F moves the Virtual Cursor to the next form field on the Web page; in forms mode, pressing the letter F types the character “f”. Auto Forms Mode Before JAWS 10, JAWS users had to enter and exit forms mode manually. Users navigated to a given control using the Virtual Cursor, and would then press the ENTER key to go into forms mode. The PC Cursor key (NUMPAD PLUS) caused JAWS to exit forms mode. When forms mode is manually activated on a given form control, focus is set to that control. Auto forms mode is a feature that tells JAWS to be smart about when to enter and exit forms mode. This is a setting which is on by default. This approach provides a seamless experience for JAWS users when both reading and interacting with a Web page. The behavior of auto forms mode depends on the type of form field in question and the keyboard command used to navigate to it. The following is a description of the keyboard commands and how they affect Web page form fields: ARROW Keys: When the Virtual Cursor is active, JAWS enters forms mode upon encountering an edit field. Focus is moved to the edit control, and users can begin typing. In forms mode, the ARROW keys move the caret within the edit field. In forms mode, if an ARROW key is pressed and the caret has already reached the boundary of the edit field, JAWS exits forms mode and resumes using the Virtual Cursor. In forms mode, pressing ESC or NUMPAD PLUS will cause JAWS to exit forms mode. Edit fields are the only controls for which JAWS enters or exits forms mode automatically based on the arrow keys. For other controls, if JAWS is using the Virtual Cursor, it will continue to use the Virtual Cursor. This is so that users don’t accidentally change the value of a control while attempting simply to navigate past it. If JAWS is already in forms mode, ARROW keys will not cause JAWS to leave forms mode. This is so that users won’t unintentionally leave forms mode while interacting with a control. When ARROW keys are used to navigate to non-edit controls, users must activate forms mode manually by pressing ENTER. TAB Keys: Using the TAB key always causes the focus point to move. When focus changes to a given form control, JAWS auto forms mode activates forms mode based on the type of the control in question. For edit fields, combo boxes, spin controls, list controls, tab controls, menu bars, tree views, and grid cells, JAWS enters forms mode automatically. For buttons and check boxes, JAWS exits forms mode. In forms mode, pressing ESC or NUMPAD PLUS will cause JAWS to exit forms mode. Note: It is possible to move to a form field by using TAB keys and to move away from that form field using ARROW keys, and vice versa. Different Control Types: In terms of Forms Mode, there are two groups of controls: those that require Forms Mode to interact with them, and those controls that never require Forms Mode to interact with them. Forms Mode is required for edit fields, combo boxes, spin controls, list controls, tab controls, menu bars, tree views, and grid cells. For these controls, press ENTER or SPACEBAR to enter Forms Mode, and ESC or NUM PAD PLUS to exit Forms Mode. For buttons and check boxes, use ENTER or SPACEBAR to activate the control at the location of the Virtual Cursor. Users interact with these controls simply by pressing ENTER or SPACEBAR; so forms mode is unnecessary. Auto Forms Mode causes JAWS to leave Forms Mode when it encounters these control types because they are just as usable without Forms Mode. For combo boxes only, ALT+DOWN ARROW causes JAWS to enter Forms Mode and drop down the list of combo box items. ALT+UP ARROW closes the list of combo box items and causes JAWS to exit Forms Mode. Finally, JAWS Auto Forms Mode behavior for radio buttons is a little different from its behavior with other types of controls. This is because unlike other controls, it is possible to interact with radio buttons in both Forms Mode and with the Virtual Cursor. When navigating with the TAB key, JAWS will stay in Forms Mode if it is already on, and it will not enter Forms Mode if it is off. Users can press SPACEBAR to choose a specific radio button when using the Virtual Cursor, and pressing the ARROW keys will not change the value of the radio button group. Users can also press ENTER to activate Forms Mode, and subsequent presses of the UP and DOWN ARROW keys will change the value of the radio button group. The following table contains the expected behavior for radio buttons with Auto Forms Mode.    Keys In Forms Mode In Virtual Cursor     ARROWS Changes radio button in group. Does not exit forms mode. Does not change radio button in group. Does not enter forms mode.   TABS Does not exit forms mode. Does not enter forms mode.   SPACEBAR n/a Selects the radio button at the cursor. Does not enter forms mode.   ENTER n/a Selects the radio button at the cursor. Enters forms mode.    Forms Mode and Application Controls A page author may mark up a Web page using the ARIA role of application.  This role indicates that the page author takes responsibility for handling of the ARROW and ESC keys while the cursor is inside the application region.  The goal is to have JAWS act as though it is inside a standard desktop application. This means that as the user tabs from control to control, JAWS will remain in Forms Mode and pass on all ARROW keys and the ESC key to the Web page. When inside an application region, JAWS treats any interactive element as a form control. This means that links, checkboxes, radio buttons, and so on are all treated like form controls requiring forms mode. This is in contrast to the manual and auto Forms Mode behaviors described earlier in this document. However, as with Forms Mode in other circumstances, users are still able to exit Forms Mode on application controls by pressing NUM PAD PLUS and they can re-enter Forms Mode either by tabbing to a new control or by pressing ENTER on a control. The user can identify controls inside an application region because they are all announced as “application controls” by jaws as the user moves through the Web page using TAB or the ARROW keys. For example, when a user encounters a link to google inside an application region, JAWS will announce, “application control link google.” An edit control will be announced as “edit application control.” Note: there is no distinction between regions of the page marked as applications and the case where the entire Web page is marked as an application. Previous versions of JAWS treated role=”application” on the body of a page differently from role=”application in other parts of a Web page. Note also that if a region is marked as a document and this region is inside an application region, the controls inside the document are treated as ordinary form controls and the standard forms mode behavior applies. Note for developers Controls containing text and without a visible caret should not be given a role of application, nor should they be nested inside an element with role of application. This is because when a user tabs to such an item they will automatically be in a mode in which they can’t use the ARROW keys to review the text with out explicitly leaving application mode, something that isn’t intuitive. If you have a block of text meeting the above criteria nested within an application, you can give sucha block a role of document or nest it within an element with role of document. If you expect the user to be able to tab to this area, be sure to give it an appropriate tabindex.    Keys Application ControlIn Forms Mode Virtual Cursor inside an application     ARROWS Passes the   key on to the application Does not   enter Forms Mode, simply announces the controls name and type   TAB Does not exit   Forms Mode unless tabbing out of an application Always enters   Forms Mode when landing on a control of any type including links, checkboxes,   radio buttons, and buttons  inside an   application   SPACEBAR If on a radio   button, checkbox, link or button, the control is activated Enters Forms Mode   on all application controls and activates the control   ENTER On buttons,   this activates the button Enters Forms Mode   and on buttons, activates the button   Navigation Quick Keys Passes the   key through to the Web page Moves from   control to control and does not enter Forms Mode   ESC key Passes the key   through to the Web page Does nothing    ARIA Roles The ARIA roles listed below are common control types that should be familiar to Windows users. These are controls that have been supported by JAWS in the Windows operating system for many years. Therefore, the expected behavior for each control type is not presented in detail. Sufficed to say, in Forms Mode, JAWS should behave comparably between controls presented on Web pages and their counterparts in standard desktop applications. Likewise, most of these control types have existed in HTML for a long time, and JAWS has supported those controls using the Virtual Cursor. In Virtual Cursor mode, JAWS behavior between a combo box created with standard HTML for example should be no different from JAWS behavior with a properly constructed JavaScript-based combo box and ARIA markup. In a few cases, ARIA markup allows for control types which were not available before in HTML. In these cases, notes may appear next to the roles in question. An important thing to understand about ARIA roles is that several roles may be combined to form the framework of one control on a page. For example, an editable grid consists of an object with the role of “grid”, having children with the role of “row”, having children with the role of “rowheader”, “columnheader”, or “gridcell”. Such controls are composed of expected patterns of roles which are described in the ARIA best practices document. If the construction of these controls is done in a way other than that described by the best practices document, JAWS may not behave as the author intends. Furthermore, states and roles also relate closely to one another. ARIA roles have a list of valid states provided in the ARIA documentation. Although the specific set of states supported by JAWS is not listed with each role, a reasonable standard of common usage applies to the acceptable states for each role. For example, the state of “aria-required” makes no sense when applied to a graphic. And the state of “aria-readonly” is superfluous when applied to a check box. JAWS attempts to filter out extraneous information for certain control types. So, page Authors should use the ARIA documentation as a guide, and report any discrepancies to Freedom Scientific. Note: Some supported roles, such as those for landmark regions, have been omitted from the below list, but will be discussed later in this document.  The following is a list of roles which JAWS recognizes:   Role Comments     alert This role does not   appear in either the virtual buffer or Forms Mode, but its contents are   spoken by JAWS when an alert is made visible.   alertdialog    button If this control has   aria-haspopup=”true” then this is a button menu.  If this control has   aria-pressed defined then this is a toggle button.   checkbox    columnheader    combobox    dialog This role will be   announced only when a child of the dialog gets focus, and will not appear in   the virtual buffer.   document This role may not be   explicitly announced by JAWS, but it indicates that the area it occupies is   meant to be read as a Web page. This is the default role of the topmost   object in a Web page (i.e., the “body” tag).   Grid    gridcell    group Like document, this   role may not be explicitly announced by JAWS. However, when it surrounds a   group of form controls, JAWS should announce its name and description when   entering the group.   heading The aria-level gives   the heading level   img    link    list    listbox    listitem    menu    log Presently, this role   is known to work with JAWS in Firefox only, and it functions as a type of   live region.  JAWS inserts start and   end strings into the virtual buffer to indicate the log.   menubar    menuitem    menuitemcheckbox    menuitemradio    Note JAWS inserts start   and end strings into the virtual buffer to indicate notes.   option    presentation This role indicates   that a feature of a Web page exists for visual formatting only. Therefore,   JAWS ignores objects with this role. (Known to work in Firefox.)   progressbar    radio    radiogroup    row    rowheader    separator    Scrollbar Uses the   aria-orientation to determine the type of scroll bar (vertical or horizontal)   slider    spinbutton JAWS announces this   role as a “spin box”.   tab    tablist    tabpanel    textbox    toolbar This role is   indicated in the virtual buffer by start and end messages like those that   exist for HTML lists.   tooltip This role is not   shown by JAWS in the virtual buffer or in Forms Mode, but its contents are   spoken when it becomes visible.   tree When in the virtual   buffer, JAWS may show only one item of a tree control. This allows the user   to navigate past the tree quickly.   treegrid    treeitem     ARIA States The same principle of reasonable common usage applies to ARIA states as applied above to roles. Note: Some states, such as those related to drag and drop, have been omitted from the below list, but will be discussed later in this document. The following is a list of states which JAWS recognizes:    State Comments     aria-activedescendant JAWS uses this state   to locate the focused items in tree views, list boxes, and other such   controls that manage multiple, focusable children.   aria-busy In Firefox, an element   marked as aria-busy is omitted from the accessibility tree for the page.   aria-checked    aria-describedby    aria-disabled JAWS   announces this state for form controls.   aria-expanded JAWS announces this   state when in Forms Mode in tree controls.   aria-haspopup JAWS announces this   state for any control except buttons and combo boxes which pops up a menu. .   aria-hidden    aria-invalid JAWS announces this   state for form controls.   aria-label    aria-level JAWS announces the   level of tree items when in Forms Mode.   aria-multiline JAWS uses this state to identify multiline edit controls.   aria-orientation JAWS uses this state   to determine if a slider is oriented horizontally or vertically.   aria-posinset JAWS announces this   information when in Forms Mode for trees and lists.   aria-pressed JAWS announces the   pressed state of a toggle button.   aria-readonly JAWS uses this state   to identify edit fields that are navigable with a caret, but whose content   cannot be changed.   aria-required JAWS announces this   state for form controls.   aria-selected    aria-setsize JAWS announces this   information when in Forms Mode for trees and lists.   aria-valuetext     ARIA Relationships Using ARIA, a page author can specify relationships among elements. JAWS supports the use of the following relationships:    Relationship Comments   aria-describedby JAWS announces this   state for form controls. The user can read the describedby text using INSERT+ALT+R.   aria-labelledby JAWS announces this   state for form controls.   Aria-flowto &   aria-flowfrom When the author   defines these relationships on elements in a Web page, JAWS will announce   that the element has a “flows from” or “flows to” relationship. The user can   move to “flows to” elements using the EQUALS Navigation Quick Key and to “flows from” using the SHIFT+EQUALS Navigation Quick Key.   Aria-controls JAWS will announce   that an element has the “controls” relationship to another element on the   page. The user can move to the controlled element using INSERT+ALT+M.    Document Regions JAWS announces the type and text of document regions, and provides navigation to the next and previous document region on the page using the SEMICOLON and SHIFT+SEMICOLON Navigation Quick Keys. In addition, pressing INSERT+CONTROL+SEMICOLON brings up a list of document regions. Note that JAWS treats a number of elements as regions. This includes all the ARIA landmark regions along with several other region types listed below. This table also provides the text JAWS uses in the virtual buffer to indicate the start of a region.    ARIA Role/HTML5 element Virtual Buffer Text   Role=”application” <region name> application   Role=”article” element=”article” <region name> article   Role=”banner” <region name> banner   Role=”complementary” element=”aside” <region name> complementary information   Role=”contentinfo” <region name> content information   Role=”document” <region name> document   Role=”form” <region name> form   Role=”main” <region name> main region   Role=”navigation” element=”nav” <region name> navigation region   Role=”region” element=”section” <region name> region   Role=”search” <region name> search region    Live Regions JAWS supports use of the “aria-live” attribute and any of its acceptable values: “polite”, “assertive”, or “off”. JAWS will also treat regions with the ARIA role of “log” or “status” as a live region. In addition, JAWS supports use of the “aria-atomic” state on live regions. JAWS does  support use of the “aria-relevant” state in firefox. Note: Since the “aria-live” value of “rude” is no longer supported by the standard, the use of it is deprecated in JAWS, but still supported. Drag and Drop JAWS supports the ARIA drag-and-drop properties “aria-grabbed” and “aria-dropeffect”. When a Web page author applies these properties to objects on a Web page, JAWS will identify such objects as grabbable, grabbed, or droppable. The keystroke WINDOWS Key+CTRL+EQUALS opens the ARIA Drag and Drop dialog box, which shows a list of droppable objects on the page. When you select one of these objects, JAWS will move focus to it. If no droppable objects are available, JAWS will announce the message, “No droppable elements were found on the page” instead of opening the dialog box. Note: JAWS does not implement the drag and drop functionality in the sense that JAWS doesn’t grab or drop objects itself. According to the ARIA specification, that functionality should be provided by the page author. JAWS simply announces to the user that a given element is grabbable, grabbed, or droppable.  JAWS version 10 with WAI-ARIA live region support!  Posted on Friday, 22 August 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIATag: JAWS   I for one have been waiting to hear this news. One of the big 2 commercial screen readers will now support WAI-ARIA live regions. Let’s hope that this prompts GWMicro to add support in Window-Eyes. The JAWS version 10 public beta is scheduled for release during the week of August 24, 2008!  ARIA Live Region Support JAWS can announce updates to live regions of Web pages when using Firefox 3 and later or Internet Explorer 8 and later. The dynamic section of a Web page that receives constant updates, such as news headlines, business information, and weather updates, is known as a live region. By default, JAWS announces updates for Web pages containing ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Live Region markup. Web content creators add specific ARIA tags to their pages to mark regions as “live.” To stop JAWS from announcing updates, use the Announce Live Region Updates option to temporarily turn off this functionality.

Do you? The Safari 4 New features page talks about ARIA support Safari supports Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA). The ARIA standard helps web developers make dynamic web content more accessible for people with disabilities. With ARIA, sites taking advantage of advanced technologies like AJAX and JavaScript can now easily interoperate with assistive technologies. This prompted me to update the testing of the ARIA Role Support in Safari. The findings indicate minimal mapping of ARIA roles to the accessibility API’s on MAC and none on Windows.  Possible reasons for the disparity between claimed support and testing results:  Incorrect testing methdology. Only supported on latest version of MAC OS. Support does not use the standard accessibility API’s. Overzealous marketing department.  Note: Using the Safari Web Inspector Tool (on MAC or Windows) the role attribute is not listed in the properties tab of elements that have a role attribute. Supported Accessibility Roles (Safari HTML Reference) Having just published this article, I then found the Safari documentation describing accessibility roles from the WAI-ARIA specification that are supported in Safari. It states: WebKit now has elementary support for the WAI-ARIA specification. It goes on to list the roles it supports, which are pretty much the same as the results from the testing I conducted Summary WAI-ARIA has 59 possible role values (excluding abstract roles):  Safari 4 Beta on MAC exposes 15 role values correctly via The MAC accessibility API Safari 4.0 on MAC exposes 17 role values correctly via The MAC accessibility API Safari 4 Beta on Windows exposes 8 role values correctly via MSAA Safari 4.0 on Windows exposes 0 role values correctly via MSAA  Software used for testing  MAC OS X 10.4.11 Safari 4 beta Safari 4.0 Accessibility UIElementInspector   Detailed Results ARIA role tests on MAC and Windows – Safari 4 beta & Safari 4.0 Previous Testing WAI-ARIA role support – How the MAC browsers stack up  ARIA Slider, Part 2  Posted on Monday, 16 June 2008 by Hans Hillen  Category: Development Tag: HTMLTag: JAWSTag: NVDA   In my previous post I gave an example for a very minimalistic ARIA slider, with the intention of demonstrating how simple it is to add ARIA using only a few attributes. I know there are some developers out there who wishfully think that, in order to make their rich interface widgets accessible, all they have to do is add ARIA to it. Others are skeptical about ARIA for that very reason. The truth is of course that ARIA is only part of the effort, and work is required to make any widget accessible (whether you’re using ARIA or not). In this post I want to cover some of those issues and give an overview of what else to think about when creating an accessible slider.  Example Throughout this article I will be referring to a slider component I am currently working on myself, which for lack of a better name I will just call the TPG slider. The TPG slider sample page contains examples of the different types of sliders that can be created using this component. The implementation for the TPG slider was inspired by two two excellent slider related articles: Unobtrusive Slider Control Revisited by Brian McAllister and Developing an accessible slider by the Filament Group. Both articles provide a similar slider component that also supports ARIA. What to Think About When Creating an Accessible Slider Starting with the Basics: Fallback Content Since HTML does not provide us with a native slider component, we’ll have to start with a form control that HTML actually does provide. In the case of a slider, the most suitable input control is a select element. The select element prevents the user from entering an incorrect value, without having to rely on validation scripts. Additionally, it allows a value to be quickly selected using the mouse or by typing in the first digits or letters. For certain value ranges it might be a bit ‘too much’ to use a select element though. For example, a slider which ranges from 0 to 1000 units would have 1000 <object> elements, which might make the selection process a bit tedious for certain people ( and lead to bloated markup). For this reason, the TPG slider also allows a text input element to be the fall-back element. This requires a lot less HTML code to start with, but it does require the user to understand the constraints of an acceptable value. If you want offer a solution that does not depend on client side scripting, you would have to include a server-side validation process to fall back on. This goes beyond the scope of this article though. Using Unobtrusive Scripting to Build and Configure the Slider If client side scripting is available on the user agent, your slider script should kick in to start building the actual slider DOM elements. If not the user will have to use the fallback control instead. The TPG slider consists of two parts: the Slider class and the Slider manager. When the page has loaded, the manager scans the document structure for text input or select controls with a class name of ‘tpgSlider’. For each found element, a new instance of the Slider class is created, which then proceeds to create the actual slider adjacent to the fallback control. To make a widget accessible to different users it can be useful to make it configurable. The TPG slider can be configured by specifying name-value pairs in the original form control’s class name. Additionally, these parameters can be stored in a different location ( a cookie, a preferences database, etc.), and sent as a JavaScript object when the slider is constructed.The parameters let you control aspects like the slider’s size and value range, and also let you specify some ARIA properties. For example, to recreate the volume slider used in my previous post, I would need a label element and either a select control or a text input control with class name parameters: <label id=\"s1Lbl\"  for=\"s1\">volume: </label> <input id=\"s1\" type=\"text\" maxlength=\"4\"  class=\"tpgSlider tpg_thickness-1em tpg_railLength-15em  tpg_range-0-100 tpg_valueText-percent tpg_labelledby-s1Lbl\" /> Each parameter consists of a prefix (‘tpg_’), followed and a name-value pair (separated by a dash). If the value is omitted, the parameter will be considered to be a boolean with a value of ‘true’. If a values is split up using multiple dashes (as is the case for the ‘range’ parameter), the parameter is considered to be an array. The only parameter that is absolutely requried is ‘tpg_labelledby‘, which must point to the id of an existing label element. The advantage of a parameter system is that it lets developers to create a preference system, which allows users to choose how they want their widgets to appear. Throughout the rest of this article I will highlight some of the more commonly used parameters. Adding the Slider to the Document Structure When the slider is constructed, you have to decide what to do with the original form input control. In the TPg slider, the ‘tpg_removeInput‘ parameter can be used to optionally remove the original text input or select element after the slider is created. Whether or not to remove the fallback element is up to the developer, but it is important to consider the following:  Certain users may have capable technology that supports client side scripting, but still be more comfortable using traditional form controls. For example, not all screen reader users will know and understand that they have to switch to non-virtual mode in order to be able to interact with the slider. Other users may find it pleasant to be able to use both a slider and an input control. Yet other users may prefer to only interact with a slider, because they prefer to use the mouse or prefer to keep the tab order as short as possible.  For these reasons it is recommended to let the user choose whether to leave in the original control or have it removed. When the control is removed, the ‘for’ attribute of the associated label element will be updated so that it now points to the slider element. One advantage of this is that clicking on the label will move focus to the slider (but only when the slider is marked up with a natively supported form control). Dealing with Focus and Tab Order As I mentioned in my previous slider post, a slider can either receive focus on its rail or its thumb. Placing focus on the thumb can makes your slider more backwards compatible. For example, in the TPG slider, the thumb is implemented as an image input control, which is focusable and part of the tab order by default. This ensures that the slider is keyboard accessible , even in browsers that do not support the extended use of the tabindex attribute (such as current versions of Safari) . The advantage of using the rail as the focusable slider part is that screen magnifier users will have the entire slider scrolled into view when using a relatively high magnification factor. To choose which part of the slider should be focusable, the TPG slider allows you to set the tpg_thumbFocus parameter to either true or false. The TPG Sider Demo Page shows examples of both settings. Those interested in creating similar widgets should note that getting, setting, and removing tabindex values with JavaScript in a cross browser friendly way requires some additional thought. Providing a visual indication for focus is a requirement of an accessible application. It is important to note that not all browsers will draw the default focus indication (usually a dotted rectangle) on elements that are not focusable by default, such as a ‘div’ element. For this reason, you must always provide your own styles for focus indication. Ideally we would use the ‘:focus’ pseudo selector, but since this is not widely supported by Internet Explorer 7 and below you will have to add and remove a custom CSS class name on the element’s focus and blur events. In the case of the TPG slider, I have used a combination or borders and negative margins to visualize focus: .focused {  border: 0.1em solid #fff500;  margin-top: -0.1em;  margin-left: -0.1em; } Note that the border width is specified using relative values, so that it will increase when the user increases the browser text size. Also note that a more ideal (but less backwards compatible) way to visually indicate focus is to use the ‘outline’ style, which is now supported by the latest (beta) versions of all major browsers. Keyboard Accessibility For ARIA to have effect, and for any widget to be accessible, it needs to be keyboard accessible. In the case of a slider, make sure that the slider’s value is easy to change using the keyboard and does not require too many keystrokes. When in doubt, consult  WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.0. Besides using the arrow keys for single increments, also implement the home and end keys to move the thumb to the minimum and maximum value. Page Up and Page Down should allow the user to change the value using larger steps. Scaling and Sizing One aspect of accessibility that is often neglected in the development of rich interface controls is their scalability. Although all latest generation of major browsers supports zooming, there will still be users who prefer to browse their web applications using an increased text size. For this reason, your slider must always inherit the user’s selected text size. This means that either the whole slider must resize, or at least its textual parts. Also, the slider’s behavior must not break, and still give a correct indication of the currently selected value when text size is changed. The key to achieve this level of scalability is to ensure all positioning and sizing is done using relative units. This must also apply for the slider’s dynamically created units and coordinates, which is tricky as JavaScript generally only provides such dynamic information as pixel values. In order to convert these to relative units, the TPG slider manager creates a hidden <div> element that has a width and height of 1em. As the user increases the browser’s text size, this element will grow along with it. Whenever the slider needs to know the current size of 1 em in pixels, this hidden element is measured using its clientWidth property. This number is then used to convert any pixel value the slider uses into em values. For example, to position the slider thub when the slider value changes, you can use the following (simplified) code: myThumb.style.left = px2Em(newPosition) + \"em\"; In this snippet, the ‘newPosition’ variable is the pixel value calculated by the slider script. To ensure that the thumb will remain correctly positioned when the slider resizes due to a change in text size, we convert the value to ems by sending it to a function which simply divides the number by the number of pixels that currently fit in 1 em. The TPG slider’s scalability depends on two parameters, which can be specified using absolute or relative units:  tpg_railLength This specifies the slider’s width (for horizontal sliders) or height (for vertical sliders). If specified using relative units, The slider will get longer when the browser’s text size increases. tpg_thumbThickness This specifies how ‘thick’ the slider should be. To make this dimension scale, provide a relative unit. If specified using relative units, The slider will get thicker when the browser’s text size increases.  How far should your slider be able to scale without making a mess of the rest of the page? WCAG 2.0 mentions a scale factor of 200%, so try to at least support that. If your design does not permit for sliders to grow in size, at least use the parameter system to provide the user with a preference that enables a large font version of your application. This way, you can manually ensure that the large slider will fit using a customized stylesheet. As shown in this example, using an image input control as the slider’s thumb also has the advantage that you can have your image based control scale along with increases in text size, something you simply cannot do with CSS backgrounds. To prevent pixellation, it is recommended to make the original image a bit bigger than the default size. Applying the ARIA There is a lot of information regarding best practices for applying ARIA, and I will probably do a separate post just for that topic some day. For now, let’s just cover some basic points about how the ARIA is applied in this component. First of all, if you are dealing with a complex web application it is recommended to dynamically apply the ARIA role and state attributes using scripting rather than hardcoding them into the HTML source. The ARIA syntax has settled down a lot, but there is always the possibility that things may change. Using a centralized function to apply an ARIA attribute means you will only have to make that change once rather than many times. This will keep your ARIA much easier to maintain, update or disable when needed needed. For example, in order to make the TPG slider compatible with Firefox 2, a simple browser check is performed to determine whether ARIA properties need to be namespaced or not. As the correct and current syntax for ARIA must be without namespaces, this browser check will be easy to phase out once Firefox 2 becomes less used. This will take a lot less work than having having to update every ARIA attribute individually. Additional Features One important aspect of a slider is that it’s easy to read and understand. Visually you can achieve this by adding a value scale adjacent to the slider. In the TPG slider such a scale can be enabled by specifying the tpg_showScale-true parameter. Ideally a scale is included as actual text rather than an image, so that it inherits any accessibility theme the user might have enabled. At the same time, the scale should not make navigation more difficult for screen reader users browsing in virtual mode. In he TPG slider, the scales are marked up as a definition list, making it easy for screen reader users to identify and skip past the scale. It must be noted though that a slider is a typical web application control, which means that it is meant to be used in a non-virtual screen reading mode. Additionally, screen magnifier users may have problems perceiving the slider value while dragging the thumb. For this purpose the TPG slider can be shown using a dynamic label, which moves along with the thumb while it is being dragged. About the Code The TPG slider is still a work in progress, and should be considered as a proof of concept for making accessible widgets with ARIA. Here are some of the issues that have not been resolved yet.  As mentioned in my previous post, the alt attribute used for the slider’s thumb currently overrides the aria-labelledby property, making it difficult to store additional information in the alt attribute for backwards compatability. For this reason, I currently give the alt attribute the same label as the actual slider. Additionally, I use the title attribute to specify extra information about the currently selected value. Unfortunately, most screen readers will not read this property as the alt attribute is already present, so it is always important to give users the option to keep all original form controls which are fully accessible. Additionally, IE8 beta 1 incorrectly exposes the image’s ‘src’ attribute as the slider’s value. Opera does not seem to cancel key down events, causing the page to scroll when the slider’s value is changed. Also, Opera shows some visual junk when the slider is dragged. Version 9.5 beta is needed to make the slider rail properly focusable. Rail Focus does not work in Safari.  Next Time In my next post, I will discuss how slider related ARIA properties are handled when creating a double slider.  Some stuff that doesn’t work between the DOM and Shadow DOM  Posted on Tuesday, 25 March 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Been reading a few new articles on Web Components and accessibility, which lead me to re-read an old post I wrote: Notes on Web Components + ARIA. I noted the demo was broken, presumably as the web component syntax had changed since 2012. So I decided to make a few new tests:  What I found was that anything that relies upon an id association between content in the DOM and Shadow DOM breaks (note need to run latest Chrome or Firefox Nightly ,with web components flag enabled, to test): Some HTML examples:  document fragment links (#blah) – if the link target is in the shadow or visa versa  link target in shadow DOM codepen example   label for/id association in DOM for controls in the shadow DOM  label targeting input in shadow DOM codepen example    Most ARIA relationship attributes:  aria-activedescendant aria-controls aria-describedby aria-flowto aria-labelledby aria-owns  will this be fixed?

We will discuss what to think about when creating a double slider, and what changes to make to your slider’s ARIA properties.  A double slider allows the user select a range of values by specifying a minimum and maximum value, using two thumbs instead of one. For example, a double slider can be used to set a price range when searching for products, or a time window when searching for available flights. Example The TPG slider component mentioned in my previous article also allows for the creation of double sliders. The double slider example page shows a few samples. At the end of the article I will describe how to create a double slider using this component. What to Think About When Creating a Double Slider Focus and Keyboard Support Although a double slider may look like a single widget visually, it behaves as two individual sliders conceptually as well as programatically. In order to be keyboard accessible, each individual thumb must be focusable and part of the tab order. As the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.0 tells us, each thumb has the same interface as a single slider: arrow keys, page up/down and home/end keys are used to change the value. Naming and Describing Because non sighted users will perceive the double slider as separate widgets, you must make it clear for both thumbs that they are part of the same widget. The current recommendation is to add ‘range minimum’ and ‘range maximum’ in the thumb’s title. Since the TPG slider already requires a label element for each thumb, I think it will suffice to include it in the label text as well. If you want to be more verbose, you can also use the aria-describedby property to explain to the user that the thumb is part of a double slider. Don’t be too verbose though, as aria-describedby text is announced automatically by most screen readers on focus, and too much accessibility is seldom appreciated. A suitable description text would simply be: ‘part of range’. Specifying Relationships The thumbs of a double slider influence each other: the lower limit thumb move go past the upper limit thumb, and vice versa. In other words, the currently selected value of each thumb determines the limit of the other thumb. As developer, you must reflect this relationship in the sliders’ ARIA properties as well. First of all, to indicate the relationship between the thumbs you must give each of them an aria-controls property. This property takes the ID of the element that is being controlled as a value. In the case of a double slider, the thumbs control each other, so they would reference each other’s ID value. The simplified code snippet below illustrates this: <div id=\"slider1\" role=\"slider\" aria-controls=\"slider2\"></div> <div id=\"slider2\" role=\"slider\" aria-controls=\"slider1\"></div> Note: This snippet only illustrates the use of the aria-controls property, and in no way reflects a complete or properly implemented slider. As each thumb limits how far the other can be moved, you will have to dynamically update the other thumb’s limit in ARIA as well. You do this by changing the aria-valuemin and aria-valuemax properties: For example. Let’s say your horizontal double slider starts off with a value range of 0 to 100. If we drag the right thumb to 50, it means that the left thumb now can’t get further than 49. In this example we would change the aria-valuemax property on the left slider to 49. Mouse Input The keyboard input may not be much different from single sliders, but mouse input is. Obviously, the thumbs can still be dragged using the mouse, but what should happen when the user clicks on the rail? Normally the thumb either moves to the location where the rail was clicked, or it moves an increment in that direction. In the case of a double slider, we have two thumbs and one rail, so you will have to decide on which thumb responds to what and how. The TPG double slider is implemented in the following way (assuming a horizontal, left to right slider rail):  Clicking to the left of the lower limit thumb will move it to where the user clicked. Clicking to the right of the upper limit thumb moves it to where the user clicked. Clicking in the middle of two thumbs moves both thumbs one increment closer to each other. Holding the CTRL key will move them a large increment (which is the same as using the page up or page down key).  This is not necessarily how it should be done, it is how I have implemented it for now. If anybody has suggestions I would love to hear them. Using the TPG Slider To create a double slider using the TPG slider, perform the following steps:  Create two separate fallback elements (either a select or text input control) adjacent to each other. Create a separate label element for each, and have the label text specify whether the slider represents the lower or upper limit of the range. Wrap both controls in a div element, and give this a class name of tpgDoubleSlider. Any TPG slider parameters can be specified in the div element’s class name as well. The exceptions are the tpg_labelledBy, tpg_defaultMin and tpg_defaultMax values, which must be specified for the individual controls.  Give it a try by downloading the source code (still under development).

Landmark navigation is an increasingly important accessibility tool, and one that will become even more powerful as HTML5 is adopted, but it has mostly been restricted to users of “heavy” (and sometimes costly) assistive technologies (ATs) such as screen readers. Browsers do not offer keystrokes to move between landmarked regions on the page, so people who need to browse via the keyboard, but do not require the use of a screen reader, cannot benefit.  Introducing the Firefox landmark extension Some time ago, David Todd created a Firefox extension that levels the playing-field somewhat, allowing users to navigate between landmarked regions easily via the keyboard. Recently I have updated this extension with support for the landmark roles implicit in certain HTML5 elements, such as header, section and footer. Some of the elements only have implicit ARIA landmarks when they are labelled, or when they’re not contained within certain other elements. This is documented in the W3C HTML specification and is implemented by the updated extension. The reworked Firefox Landmark extension can be downloaded and used right now. However, in re-working the extension’s preferences so they don’t require a Firefox restart for changes to take effect, I discovered that the current landmark position is not preserved across browser tabs. This means that currently you will lose your position when switching between tabs – but this is definitely something I plan to resolve in future versions. Thanks very much to David Todd for his great work in creating this extension in the first place. Download the extension Read more about the extension features and download the updated Firefox Landmark extension from GitHub – comments, issue reports and contributions are welcome! We hope it will be of use in improving keyboard access and, hopefully, convincing browser developers to include this functionality out-of-the-box.

Posted on Monday, 19 January 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: ARIA   An issue with the use of WAI-ARIA in HTML documents is that they don’t validate. When you run a HTML document containing ARIA attributes through the W3C Validator it shows errors in the results for any ARIA attributes. More importantly it does not inform me of errors in the ARIA code, for example, if the role value used is incorrect in reference to the WAI ARIA specification. <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\"> When a validator’s results contains errors related to the use ARIA attributes in a document with the DOCTYPE quoted above, it is quite correct. The HTML 4.01 specification and its DOCTYPE declarations (DTD) Strict, Transitional, Frameset, do not include any information about the WAI ARIA attributes and you cannot have a valid HTML 4.01 document which includes, elements, attributes, and attribute values, not detailed in its DTD’s. This situation will not change unless the W3C decide to provide updated DTD’s which include ARIA attributes. My understanding is that this is unlikely, I don’t undesrtand the reasons so will leave it to others , more knowledgeable, to explain. Why do I Want To Validate (X)HTML + ARIA? I write HTML documents that include ARIA attributes, I want to know if the ARIA attributes and attribute values I have used are correct in reference to the ARIA specification, at the same time as checking the rest of my HTML code is correct. I don’t want to be told that the use of ARIA attributes are incorrect in HTML. Example of result error from the W3C validitor which is of no use to me when testing a simple page with the HTML4 DOCTYPE that includes the ARIA role attribute: Line 30, Column 22: there is no attribute “ROLE” . <DIV id=\"banner\" role=\"spanner\">role=\"banner\"</DIV> You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the document type you are using does not support that attribute for this element. The above result tells me that role is not a valid attribute, (I already know this), but does not tell me that “spanner” is not a valid ARIA role attribute value. Example of a useful result error from the W3C validitor: Line 25, Column 30: value of attribute “ROLE” cannot be “SPANNER”; must be one of “ALERT”, “ALERTDIALOG”, “APPLICATION”, “ARTICLE”, “BANNER”, “BUTTON”, “CHECKBOX”, “COLUMNHEADER”, “COMBOBOX”, “COMPLEMENTARY”, “CONTENTINFO”, “DEFINITION”, “DIALOG”, “DIRECTORY”, “DOCUMENT”, “GRID”, “GRIDCELL”, “GROUP”, “HEADING”, “IMG”, “LANDMARK”, “LINK”, “LIST”, “LISTBOX”, “LISTITEM”, “LOG”, “MAIN”, “MARQUEE”, “MATH”, “MENU”, “MENUBAR”, “MENUITEM”, “MENUITEMCHECKBOX”, “MENUITEMRADIO”, “NAVIGATION”, “NOTE”, “OPTION”, “PRESENTATION”, “PROGRESSBAR”, “RADIO”, “RADIOGROUP”, “REGION”, “ROW”, “ROWHEADER”, “SEARCH”, “SEPARATOR”, “SLIDER”, “SPINBUTTON”, “STATUS”, “TAB”, “TABLIST”, “TABPANEL”, “TEXTBOX”, “TIMER”, “TOOLBAR”, “TOOLTIP”, “TREE”, “TREEGRID”, “TREEITEM”. <DIV id=\"banner\" role=\"spanner\">role=\"banner\"</DIV> The value of the attribute is defined to be one of a list of possible values but in the document it contained something that is not allowed for that type of attribute. The result above tells me that the role attribute value I have used is incorrect, I have used the value “spanner” instead of “banner”, and lists the possible correct ARIA role values. What about the HTML5+ARIA conformance checker? The W3C Validator now includes an expiremental HTML5 checker which also includes ARIA checking based on rules devised by Henri Sivonen, a problem with this is these rules do not allow ARIA landmark roles. So when testing a simple HTML5 test page with landmark roles it returns results like these:   Line 30, Column 31: Bad value spanner for attribute role on element div. . <div id=\"banner\" role=\"spanner\">role=\"banner\"</div> Line 31, Column 38: Bad value navigation for attribute role on element div. <div id=\"navigation\" role=\"navigation\">role=\"navigation\"</div>   Again, these results are not useful, because they tell me that certain roles are not allowed in HTML5 (as determined by Henri), but not whether I have any incorrect attributes and values in reference to WAI ARIA. Checking not Choking: Using A Custom DTD In order to get the W3C validator to check the role attribute, but not choke on it, I have used a custom DTD. The DTD I have used is the HTML 4.01 loose DTD with ARIA attributes added (HTML4-ARIA.DTD). I took the HTML 4.01 loose.dtd and added all the ARIA attributes and attribute values to the core attributes section. I have also added the tabindex attribute to the core attributes, removing it from individual elements, and provided it with a value property which allows negative values. I then uploaded the DTD file to the TPG web server. (Note: This is really a quick and dirty edit for the purposes of testing the concept only). So when I use a custom DOCTYPE in a simple test page that references the HTML4-ARIA.DTD and run it through the W3C HTML validator, the validator uses the DTD to check my document. What I get as as a result is the ability to check the correctness of my use of ARIA attributes and attribute values, also i don’t get nagged about the use of tabindex=\"-1\" or the tabindex on elements that traditionally do not support its use. Problems Let me state clearly at this stage. I am not advocating the publishing of documents using this or any other custom DTD. I am no expert, but do get the idea that this is bad news. Currently the W3C validator does not like the custom DTD because it has too many additional attributes and attribute values. Thus before any error results in the actual code it returns this about 20 times: Line xxx, Column 2: number of attribute names and name tokens (167) exceeds ATTCNT (60) This does not appear to affect the correct reporting of results against the custom DTD, it’s is just really annoying. I have emailed the W3C validator team to see if they can suppress this error. (Note: this has since been fixed by the W3C validator team on the Development version of the validator, so I have modified the bookmarklets to point to the dve validator) As I mentioned previously I am not advocating the use of a custom DTD in published documents, but would like to be able to check my ARIA code. A way I have developed to do this is by creating a bookmarklet that takes the innerHTML of a document (without the DOCTYPE) and adds the custom DOCTYPE to it and then sends it to the W3C validator:  HTML4.01-loose+ARIA Checker (add as a favorite to try it out) HTML4.01-strict+ARIA Checker  Notes: The (X)THML + ARIA validation is based on attributes and attribute values as defined in the WAI-ARIA (draft) specification 1.0. The DTD’s are not official versions and have not been endorsed by anyone. Validation of HTML 4.01 documents using the experimental DTD’s, will detect errors in WAI-ARIA attribute names and values only. The DTD’s allow ARIA attributes to be placed on any element. It will not provide any indication of the correctness of the use of a WAI-ARIA attribute on any given element. Next Steps I have undertaken this exercise, because people have asked about ARIA validation and I myself wanted to be able to check documents containing ARIA. What I hope is that The W3C validator adds support for (X)HTML +ARIA documents so I when check a document and it contains no errors in the HTML (except for the use of ARIA) and ARIA code, I see a message like this:  If this does not happen and there is sufficient interest, I will look at hosting a version of the W3C validator which provides HTML+ARIA checking without the reams of unhelpful error results.  Building an Accessible Disclosure Button – using Web Components  Posted on Tuesday, 24 June 2014 by Cédric Trévisan  Category: Strategy   Web components are the next step in building modern web applications and a great way to prototype accessible widgets. Today we are going to build a disclosure widget, by extending the native HTML button element. Web components are a collection of several standards (Templates, Shadow DOM, Custom elements, Imports) that allow us to create reusable elements and encapsulate the complexity of code and style into the component.    The support for Web components varies amongst browsers. So in order to use it now we are going to use the Polymer library. Registering the component. Before using our component, we need to register it. For usability and clean separation, we are going to declare our component in a separate file: w3c-disclosure.html The first thing we need to add in our file, is to import the polymer library, in order to enable the shadow DOM, custom elements, … <link rel=\"import\" href=\"components/polymer/polymer.html\">  Then we declare the component like this: <polymer-element name=\"w3c-disclosure\" extends=\"button\">  The element name for the component, (‘w3c-disclosure’) must always contain a dash (-). The extends directive indicates that the component is an extension of the existing HTML button element .  We also create a base template structure for the shadow DOM subtree, and a JavaScript constructor. So now our component code looks like this: <link rel=\"import\" href=\"components/polymer/polymer.html\">  <polymer-element name=\"w3c-disclosure\" extends=\"button\">     <template>     </template>     <script>         Polymer(\\'w3c-disclosure\\', {             ready: function() {             },         });     </script> </polymer-element>  Using the component On the page where the component will be used, you need to load the Polymer platform library before any other JavaScript library, in the <head> section. <script src=\"components/platform/platform.js\"></script> Then we need to import the component description. <link rel=\"import\" href=\"w3c-disclosure.html\"> Now we can use our component in the page like any HTML element: <button is=\"w3c-disclosure\">Expand section 1</button> Custom elements that inherit from native elements are called type extension custom elements. They inherit from a specialized version of HTMLElement and that means it can’t be used directly as a tag (<w3c-disclosure></w3c-disclosure>), instead we need to use the ‘is’ syntax. Adding accessibility logic and style. So far our component does nothing more than a regular button. So we are now going to see how to extend the button behaviour to add our disclosure feature. In the components declaration use the ‘attributes’ directive to declare added public attributes. For our button we are going to add two attributes: controlfor and expanded <polymer-element name=\"w3c-disclosure\" extends=\"button\"  attributes=\"controlfor expanded\" on-click=\"{{buttonClick}}\">  controlfor, references the disclosed section id expanded, if present, the section will be expanded on page load on-click attribute is bound to the ‘click’ event so the buttonClick function is called on each button click event  Now we update the component in the page, to use those attributes. <button is=\"w3c-disclosure\" controlfor=\"details1\">Expand section 1</button> <section id=\"details1\">     Lorem ipsum … </section> Next we need to add the button logic, into the Web Component JavaScript. The ready function: is the component constructor. Called on the WebComponentsReady event. With this function we initialize states and an aria attribute when the component is loaded. ready: function() {     // If the expanded attribute is present, then the initial state is expanded.     if (this.expanded === null) this.expanded = false;     else this.expanded = true;     // We map the controlfor attribute to the aria-controls attribute.     this.setAttribute(\\'aria-controls\\', this.controlfor);     // We set a pointer to the disclosed content     this.target = document.querySelector(\\'#\\' + this.controlfor); }, The buttonClick function: is called on every ‘click’ event. When the button is clicked, we toggle the expanded state. buttonClick: function(event, detail, sender) {     this.expanded = !this.expanded; }, The expandedChanged function: is called when the expanded variable has been updated. The Polymer data-binding feature automatically links the ‘expanded’ attribute to expandedChanged function so the function is called when the value for the variable has changed. In this function we set aria states, and toggle the disclosed content. expandedChanged: function(oldValue, newValue) {     // We map the expanded value to the aria-expanded state     this.setAttribute(\\'aria-expanded\\', newValue);     // We hide/show the content using the hidden attribute     this.target.hidden = !newValue;     //For backward compatibility, we also set the CSS display attribute     if (newValue) { // expanded is true         this.target.style.display=\\'block\\';     } else {         this.target.style.display=\\'none\\';     }\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t },  Styling The widget has now all the logic implemented, and we are going to add a little icon to visually indicate the expanded state. In the template area, we add the following CSS rules: <style type=\"text/css\">     :host #icon:before {         content:\"?\"; font-size: 1em;     }     :host #icon.expanded:before {         content:\"?\"; font-size: 1em;     } </style> Many other techniques can be used for displaying icons. We used this one, with the ‘content’ attribute, for simplicity, in our demo. The :host element represents the custom element itself, and allows the component to be styled from outside. One last little trick: when your page is hosted online, you may notice some delay, for the disclosure content, to be hidden, when the page loads. It is due to the time the browser needs to load Polymer and apply the component polyfill. For this issue Polymer provides a solution that hides the page content, until all elements are loaded. Add the ‘unresolved’ attribute to body: <body unresolved> Example use of w3c-disclosure button Multiple w3c-disclosure buttons could be used in a list to allow the user to collapse a set of fields down to a small set of headings, with the ability to open each one.  In conclusion. If you already know HTML and JavaScript, Web Components are easy to create and give us a great way to extend and improve regular HTML elements. And thanks to the Polymer or X-tags polyfill libraries, you can use it right now to create out-of-the-box accessible widgets, or improve existing Web Components by adding ARIA roles and attributes. Resources:  disclosure-button – working demo 1 and working demo 2 disclosure-button repo on github Notes on Using ARIA in HTML disclosure-button custom control Usability and accessibility opportunities in a web component world   A (not so) short note on ARIA to the rescue  Posted on Saturday, 8 October 2016 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   Native HTML elements don’t require the addition of ARIA attributes to expose the semantics they have, as, for the most part, browsers expose this information: YAY.  This is expressed in the ARIA specification: …there are many situations in which WAI-ARIA semantics are redundant with host language semantics. It is also expressed in HTML as a set of rules to dissuade developers from unecessarily adding ARIA attributes, acting under the falsehood that it is somehow beneficial.   Setting an ARIArole and/or aria-* attribute that matches the default implicit ARIA semantics is unnecessary and is not recommended as these properties are already set by the browser. Default Implicit ARIA semantics – should not be used This why developers who do so and check their HTML conformance with the HTML standard will get warnings like this:  And this is a good thing. Although in most circumstances the presence of ARIA semantics that duplicates default implicit semantics will not have a detrimental effect, addition of unecessary attributes leads to extra work, code bloat, and can lead to errors. SHOULD NOT, because sometimes… We have a client, who has set on an environment for particular reasons, that uses a locked down version of Chrome and allows only JAWS as a screen reader. JAWS does not officially support Chrome and while Chrome does a good job at exposing the correct information for Assistive Technology (AT), sometimes the AT falls short in making use of the information or does not interpret the information correctly. Sometimes the issue may be a regression in a new version of the software and will hopefully be fixed in the next version. Other times it’s a long standing bug in the browser or AT. As accessibility practioners/engineers/developers (call yourself what you will), we have to take a view on whether to advise the client to implement a work around or code the workaround ourselves, or whether users can take a hit, as it’s a temporary problem and not a show stopper for users. In the case above the issue was that JAWS in combination with Chrome (as of version <=51) does not correctly identify heading (H1-h6) levels, so content structure/hierarchy is not conveyed. The problem here is with JAWS, Chrome exposes headings correctly in the accessibility tree. i.e. a <h1> has a role=heading and a level=1, a <h3> has a role=heading and a level=3, but JAWS reports all headings (h1-h6) as “heading level 2” doh! As mentioned earlier, the environement is a set version of chrome (51) and a set version of JAWS (17) so me thinks this is not an issue that will go away soon, and users of this system will be at a disadvantage because of this. The initial advice was to at least provide some information up front to JAWS users, so they were aware of the issue. Then I thought I would try adding the aria-level attribute to the headings with a value that matches the default level of the heading: <h1 aria-level=\"1\">... <h2>... <h3 aria-level=\"3\">...  I wasn’t super optimistic about this having an effect, as I know that the attributes through which ARIA can be used to manipulate the browser accessibility tree properties are exposed via the platform accessibility API properties/values (where they exist) rather than any ARIA magic, and both level and role=heading are standard across accessibility APIs. To my surprise use of aria-level worked, you can try it yourself in chrome/JAWS: See the Pen headings with and without aria-level by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.  That it worked told me that JAWS is likely doing some DOM hacking and picking up the aria-level  attribute rather than reading the correct value already conveyed by chrome through the Accessibility Tree. Point is it worked and the client can be advised on a simple workaround to support the correct semantics for users. NOTE This is a tale of a particular circumstance where going against the general rule of ARIA not being required to expose native HTML semantics, was of benefit.  It is in no way meant to suggest that adding aria-level to h1-h6 is required or recommended in general. It is a bug in JAWS that needs to be fixed. Further reading  Short Note on HTML conformance checking On HTML belts and ARIA braces (The Default Implicit ARIA semantics they didn’t want you to know about)     Custom Element Semantics  Posted on Tuesday, 5 April 2016 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   The following content written by me, was until recently a part of the W3C Custom Elements specification, but was removed/substantially re-written when a new editor took over. As we think, in the form represented here, it’s a useful introduction to custom element semantics, we have re-published it. Custom Element Semantics The default semantics of a custom element is dependent upon the form in which it is instantiated:  by default a custom tag has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. by default a type extension inherits the semantics of the element type it extends.   Custom Tag Example For example, a custom tag could be named taco-button, but the name alone does not express the semantics of a HTML button element simply due to its name. As instantiated a custom tag conveys a similar amount of semantics as an HTML div or span element: <!-- taco-button represents a span with a fancy name --> <taco-button></taco-button> The addition of visual styling and scripted events to the taco-button could provide hints as to its semantics and expected interaction behaviours — for some users — but for the semantics to be formally expressed developers must convey the semantics using ARIA roles, states and properties. The addition of a tabindex attribute to the custom element provides interaction (the element is included in the focus order) and property/state semantics (it exposes information that it is focusable and if it currently has focus). <!-- taco-button represents a focusable span with a fancy name --> <taco-button tabindex=\"0\">Eat Me</taco-button> The addition of a label, using aria-label, to the custom element provides an Accessible Name for the element. <!-- taco-button represents a focusable span with a fancy name and a text label --> <taco-button tabindex=\"0\" aria-label=\"Eat Me\">Eat Me</taco-button> The addition of keyboard event handlers to the custom element provides the means for keyboard users to operate the control, but does not convey the presence of the functionality. <!-- taco-button represents focusable span with a fancy name,     a text label and button like event handling --> <taco-button tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"alert(\\'tasty eh?\\');\" onkeypress=\"if(event.keyCode==32||event.keyCode==13){alert(\\'tasty eh?\\');};\" >Eat Me</taco-button> Note: The addition of inline event handlers are for demonstration purposes only. The event handlers could be added by the lifecycle callbacks imperatively, or maybe even not used at all. This example demonstrates one method for developers to ensure that a custom control is operable for keyboard users and meets the WCAG 2.0 [WCAG20] criteria “All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface”. The addition of an ARIA role=\"button\" conveys the custom element’s role semantics, which enables users to successfully interact with the control using the expected button interaction behaviours (pressing the space or enter keys to activate). <!-- taco-button represents a focusable button with a text label     and button like event handling --> <taco-button role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"alert(\\'tasty eh?\\');\" onkeypress=\"if(event.keyCode==32||event.keyCode==13){alert(\\'tasty eh?\\');};\" >Eat Me</taco-button> The developer may provide a disabled state for the custom element. This could be implemented by removing the tabindex attribute so the element is no longer included in the focus order and removing the functionality so that interacting with the element does nothing. Also the visual styling may also be modified to visually indicate it the element is disabled. <!-- grayed out non focusable taco-button with functionality removed,      to indicate the button is in a disabled state  --> <taco-button role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"alert(\\'tasty eh?\\');\" onkeypress=\"if(event.keyCode==32||event.keyCode==13){alert(\\'tasty eh?\\');};\" >Eat Me</taco-button> Removing the focusability and functionality of the custom element and modifying its style does not unambiguously express that it is in a disabled state. To unambiguously express the disabled state add aria-disabled=\"true\". <!-- taco-button represents a focusable button with a text label        and button like event handling --> <taco-button role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" onclick=\"alert(\\'tasty eh?\\');\"   onkeypress=\"if(event.keyCode==32||event.keyCode==13){alert(\\'tasty eh?\\');};\"   aria-disabled=\"true\">Eat Me</taco-button> Note: A disabled attribute would not work here as the custom tag is not based on an HTML element that supports its use. Type Extension Example A type extension, for example could extend the HTML button element. As instantiated it would inherit the button element’s name, role, states and properties, built in focus and keyboard interaction behaviours. <!-- tequila-button represents a button with an accessible name of \"Drink Me!\" --> <button is=\"tequila-button\">Drink Me!</button> To implement the desired tequila-button feature, all that is required is the addition of an event handler. The rest of the semantics and interaction behaviour are provided by the browser as part of its implementation of the button element. <!-- tequila-button represents a button --> <button is=\"tequila-button\" onclick=\"alert(\\'smooth!\\');\">Drink Me!</button> To implement the disabled state on the tequila-button, all that is required is the addition of the HTML disabled attribute. The semantics, style and interaction behaviour are implemented by the browser. <!-- tequila-button represents a button --> <button is=\"tequila-button\" onclick=\"alert(\\'smooth!\\');\" disabled>Drink Me!</button>   Custom Element Semantics — Conclusion The simplest and most robust method to create custom elements that are usable and accessible is to implement custom elements as type extensions. This method provides a custom element with built in semantics and interaction behaviours that developers can use as a foundation. Use ARIA , where needed, to provide semantics for custom elements and follow the ARIA Design Patterns when implementing ARIA attributes and UI interaction behaviours. Ensure that custom tag or type extension custom elements meet the criteria listed in the Custom Control Accessible Development Checklist . Use ARIA in accordance with the Document conformance requirements for use of ARIA attributes in HTML.

A recent question on Stack Overflow got me thinking: What is the best method for hiding content for all users? For hiding content for some users?  The standard technique for hiding content for all users has been the use CSS display:none. Now, both ARIA and HTML5 also provide a semantic indication of content state that indicates content is hidden or should not be available to users: HTML5 hidden The HTML5 hidden attribute provides a semantic indicator: All HTML elements may have the hidden content attribute set. The hidden attribute is a boolean attribute. When specified on an element, it indicates that the element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant. User agents should not render elements that have the hidden attribute specified. Example code: <p hidden>This content is hidden.</p>  HTML5 hidden effects:  In supporting browsers the content is not displayed to any user. semantic indicator of state in HTML code (hidden attribute) CSS style of display:none applied by browser. Focusable content is not included in tab order. Not included in the accessibility tree.  aria-hidden Indicates that the element and all of its descendants are not visible or perceivable to any user as implemented by the author. Example code: <p aria-hidden=\"true\">This content is hidden.</p> <p aria-hidden=\"false\">This content is not hidden.</p>  <!-- aria-hidden=\"false\" is same as -->  <p aria-hidden=\"true\">This content is hidden.</p> <p>This content is not hidden.</p> aria-hidden effects:  In supporting browsers in conjunction with supporting assistive technology the content is not conveyed to the user via the assistive technology. Content is displayed in the browser. semantic indicator of state in HTML code (aria-hidden attribute) In some browsers its not included in the accessibility tree in other browsers it is included in the accessibility tree.  For browser that include aria-hidden content in the accessibility tree focusable content is  included in tab order and is navigable and operable for AT users (as well as other users).   In browsers that do include the content in the accessibility tree the content has an accessible MSAA (if supported) state of invisible. If IA2 is supported aria-hidden=true is passed as an object attribute. If UIA is supported aria-hidden=true is passed as an ARIA property. aria-hidden=false is not mapped in any browser that supports aria-hidden, thus its use has no meaning or in other words has the same meaning as its absence.  CSS display:none As mentioned, the standard method to hide content from all users in browsers that support CSS is and has been to use CSS display:none. Example code: <p style=\"display:none\">This content is hidden.</p> display:none effects:  In supporting browsers the content is not displayed to any user. Focusable content is not included in tab order. Not included in the accessibility tree (except for IE) In IE the content has an accessible MSAA (if supported) state of invisible.  If UIA is supported OffScreen=true.  Recommendations: Hiding content from all users If you want to hide content from all users, use the HTML5 hidden attribute (along with CSS display:none for browsers that do not yet support hidden) There is no need to use aria-hidden. Example code: .hidden {display:none} <p hidden class=\"hidden\">this content is hidden from all users</p> Hiding non interactive content from visible display Use an off screen technique to remove content from visible display, but still available to screen reader users: Example code:  .offscreen  {  clip-path: inset(100%);  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* IE 6/7 */   clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);   height: 1px;   overflow: hidden;   position: absolute;   white-space: nowrap; /* added line */   width: 1px;  }  <div class=\"offscreen\">This text is visually hidden.</div> Modified example code from: WebAIM – CSS in Action: Invisible Content Just for Screen Reader Users Updated code examples, October 2016,  to take into account new advice from Jessica Beach: Beware smushed off-screen accessible text Hiding interactive content from visible display Hiding interactive (focusable) content from visible display using the off screen technique means it is not visible, but still  in the tab order and causes issues for keyboard only users. Focusable content should only be hidden from visible display if the focusable element becomes visible when it recieves focus: Example code:  a.offscreen {  clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* IE 6/7 */   clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);   height: 1px;   overflow: hidden;   position: absolute;   white-space: nowrap; /* added line */   width: 1px;  }  a.offscreen:focus  { position:relative;  clip:auto;  width:auto;  height:auto;  overflow:auto;  }  <a class=\"offscreen\" href=\"test.html\">this link is offscreen unless it has focus</a> Notes by Ted Drake, on use of the off screen technique described: Using negative position can create long scroll bars when localizing a site for a rtl language. Also, it uses CSS properties that are commonly used and easy to accidentally over-ride. The Yahoo Accessibility Lab recommends using clip for content that should be hidden from the visual user, yet available to screen reader users. Thierry Koblentz has a great article on this technique, as well as the underlying philosophy behind using the correct CSS techniques for hiding content. Clip your hidden content for better accessibility The tests Support for aria-hidden, HTML5 hidden and the off screen technique was tested using JAWS, Window Eyes and NVDA (Windows), ChromeVox (Chrome OS), VoiceOver (iOS and Mac OSX) and Orca (Linux) with supporting browsers for each OS. Result summary  Use of HTML5 hidden (+ CSS display:none) worked in all screen reader/browser combinations tested. Use of the off screen technique worked in all screen reader/browser combinations tested. Use of aria-hidden=true worked in some screen reader/browser combinations tested. Use of aria-hidden=false had no effect in any of the screen reader/browser combinations tested. In other words if content is hidden from all users using HTML5 hidden or display:none applying aria-hidden=false to the content does not make it visible to screen reader users.

Note: this information is now being actively maintained as part of Using ARIA in HTML.  The first rule of ARIA use If you can use a native HTML element or attribute instead of an ARIA role, state or property, then do so. Under what circumstances may this not be possible?  If the visual design constraints rule out the use of a particular  native element, because the element cannot be styled as required. If the feature is not currently available in HTML. If the feature is available in HTML but it is not implemented or it is implemented, but accessibility support is not.  The Second rule of ARIA use Do not change native  semantics, unless you really have to. For example: Developer wants to build a heading that’s a button. Do not do this: <h1 role=button>heading button</h1> Do this: <h1><span role=button>heading button</span></h1> Or better, do this: <h1><button>heading button</button></h1> Note: it is OK to use native HTML elements, that have similar semantics to ARIA roles used, for fallback. For example using HTML list elements for the skeleton of an ARIA enabled, scripted tree widget. What does adding a role do to the native semantics? Adding an ARIA role overrides the native role semantics. For example: <h1 role=button>text</h1> Becomes this in the accessibility tree: <button>text</button> What  adding a role does not do? Adding an ARIA role does not change the  behaviours, states and properties For example: This: <button role=heading>text</button> Becomes this in the accessibility tree: <heading>text</heading> But it is can still be pressed, it is still in the default tab order,  still looks like a button, still triggers any associated actions when  pressed. That’s why it is a HTML5 conformance error to change a button into a heading. Note: likewise, changing the role of an element does not add behaviours, properties or states of the role used. You must add those yourself. Add ARIA inline or via script? If the ARIA role or aria-* attribute does not rely on scripting to  provide interaction behaviour, then it is safe to include the ARIA  markup inline. For example, it is fine to add ARIA landmark roles or ARIA labelling and describing roles inline. If the content and interaction is only supported in a  scripting enabled browsing context, for example Google docs applications require JavaScript enabled to work, so  it is safe for them to include the ARIA  markup inline. Google spreadsheet application displaying a message \\'Your browser must support JavaScript.\\' Otherwise add ARIA via scripting. ARIA validation The easiest method is to use the HTML5 DOCTYPE with ARIA markup and validate using the W3C Nu Markup Validation Service.   ARIA works equally well with any other DOCTYPE, but validation tools  will produce errors when they encounter ARIA markup as the associated  DTDs have not been updated to recognise ARIA markup and it is unlikely  they ever will be. Use of role=presentation role=presentation removes the semantics from the element it is on. For example. This: <h1 role=presentation>text</h1> becomes this: <>text</> For elements with no required children, any elements nested inside the element with role=presentation preserve their semantics. For example. This: <h1 role=presentation><abbr>API</abbr></h1> becomes this: <><abbr>API</abbr></> For elements with  required children (such as ul or table any required child elements nested inside the element with role=presentation also have their semantics removed. For example, This: <table role=presentation> <tr><td><abbr>API</abbr></td><tr> </table> becomes this: <> <><><abbr>API</abbr></></> </> Note: Any elements that are not required children of the element with a role=presentation keep their semantics. This includes other elements with required children. For example; <table role=presentation> <tr><td> <table> <tr><td><abbr>API</abbr></td><tr> </table> </td><tr> </table> Becomes this: <> <><> <table> <tr><td><abbr>API</abbr></td><tr> </table> </><> </> aria-labelledby and aria-describedby Currently aria-labelledby and aria-describedby are only robustly supported for associating text content to a subset of interactive content elements, they do not work correctly on links, support on embedded content is unknown, but can be safely used on form controls inlcuding the many input types. In Internet Explorer, if you use aria-labelledby with multiple id references or aria-describedby with single or multiple id references, the referenced elements must be what Microsoft terms as accessible HTML elements. The following example of aria-labelledby with multiple references uses the label element as it makes sense and it’s an accessible element (in IE terms). The example could have used a span (for example) but then tabindex=-1 would have to be added. Refer to Making Non accessible Elements Accessible <label id=\"l1\" for=\"f3\">label text </label> <input type=\"text\" id=\"f3\" aria-labelledby=\"l1 l2\"> <p>other content</p> <label id=\"l2\">more label text</label> Abstract roles Do not use the following abstract roles as they do not do anything! Abstract roles are used for the ontology. Authors MUST NOT not use abstract roles in content.  command (abstract role) composite (abstract role) input (abstract role) landmark (abstract role) range (abstract role) roletype (abstract role) section (abstract role) sectionhead (abstract role) select (abstract role) structure (abstract role) widget (abstract role) window (abstract role)       Further reading:  WAI-ARIA 1.0 Authoring Practices HTML5 Accessibility Chops: When to use an ARIA role HTML5 and the myth of WAI-ARIA redundance   HTML5 Accessibility Chops: section elements  Posted on Wednesday, 9 March 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   HTML5 introduces new section elements. The new elements include header, footer, section, article, nav and aside. What is the accessibility potential of these new elements for users of assistive technology such as screen readers? To understand the potential of these new elements to provide a better experience for screen reader users it is useful to understand how the semantics of current structural elements such as the  h1, h2,   h3, h4,   h5, and h6 elements is exposed to users. How HTML elements are supported by screen readers Typical support patterns of HTML elements by screen readers:  Identification of an element by role as the user moves through the content. Announcement of the text content of an element. Announcement of the start and end of an element. Change in voice as the content of an element is announced. Announcement of an elements accessible name and/or description Announcement of states and properties. Emission of a beep or other sound when an element with a particulat state or property receives virtual focus. Instructions on how to operate interactive elements such as form controls. Navigation of elements by keyboard and “quick access” lists of a particular elements, list items are linked to each instance of an element on the page.  Note: The combination of patterns supported varies from element to element and support for a particular element varies between screen reader software. Examples of HTML element support by screen reader software The following table illustrates support and interaction features for a number of structural HTML elements. The information is based on support for these elements by the JAWS screen reader.    Element Support behaviour keystrokes   blockquote Navigate by and list instances of blockquote element in the document. Announces when the virtual cursor enters or exits a blockquote element. If the cite attribute is present, its value is announced.   next blockquote  Q previous blockquote  SHIFT+Q blockquote list  CTRL+INSERT+Q     h1 to h6 Navigate by and list instances of h1-h6 elements in the document. Heading level announced “heading level x + heading text content” when the heading receives virtual focus.   List Headings INSERT+F6 Next Heading  H Prior Heading  SHIFT+H First Heading  ALT+INSERT+HOME  Last Heading  ALT+INSERT+END Next Heading at Level 1 through 6  Prior Heading at Level SHIFT+1 through 6 First Heading at Level ALT+CTRL+INSERT+1 through 6  Last Heading at Level ALT+CTRL+INSERT+SHIFT+1 through 6 Announce heading of the section of the page you are in INSERT+T     p Navigate by and list instances of p elements in the document. When the element recieves virtual focus the content is announced.   Next Paragraph P Previous Paragraph SHIFT+P List Paragraphs CTRL+INSERT+P     ol, ul, li Announces “list of x items” at the start of a list and “list end” at the end of a list. For ordered lists the counter is announced before the content of each list item. for unordered lists “bullet” is announced before the content of each item.   Move to Next List L  Move to Prior List SHIFT+L Select List F8 List All Ordered, Unordered, and Definition Lists CTRL+INSERT+L  Move to Next Item in a List I  Move to Prior Item in a List SHIFT+I      What form will support for the new HTML5 section elements take? Authors can already apply ARIA roles to section elements where appropriate. One possibility is that the elements can be mapped to WAI-ARIA roles, most of which are supported by screen readers now. Browser implementors are starting to add experimental support for some of the new elements. Authors can already apply ARIA roles to section elements where appropriate: Note: there are some issues with outdated buggy assistive technology not playing well with HTML5 elements on their own or when ARIA roles are added.  Recommended ARIA role mappings for HTML5 section elements   HTML5 element WAI-ARIA role   article  <article role=”article”> article   footer    ONLY when not a descendent of an article or section element. In other words, only the main footer for a page. <footer role=”contentinfo”> contentinfo   header    ONLY when not a descendent of an article or section element. In other words, only the main header for a page. <header role=”banner”> banner   nav  <nav role=”navigation”> navigation   aside  <aside role=”complementary”> complementary   section  <section role=”region”> region   h1, h2,   h3, h4,   h5, and h6  These elements have been around for ages, so where they can be mapped in browsers they already are, adding a heading role is an unecessary duplication. NONE    address  <address role=”contentinfo”> contentinfo   hgroup  Both the semantics and the status of the hgroup element in HTML5 are undecided, so best leave it out for the time being. NONE    body  This element has been around for ages, so where it can be mapped in  browsers it already is, adding an ARIA document role is an unecessary  duplication. While the ARIA application role can also be used on body it is advised to do so with caution. NONE     ARIA Landmark Roles A subset of HTML5 section elements map onto ARIA landmark roles. Landmark roles already have good support in screen reader such as JAWS, VoiceOver (on iOS), NVDA and Orca. So when implemented in browsers some of the new section elements will be included as ARIA Landmarks without the need to explicitly apply an ARIA role attribute. For the other new section elements, how and when they will be accessibility supported is less clear.  Notes on use of multiple ARIA role attribute values  Posted on Thursday, 15 October 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: StandardsCategory: Testing   The role attribute in HTML can have multiple space separated values :    3.2.7.3.1 ARIA Role Attribute Every HTML element may have an ARIA role attribute specified. This is an ARIA Role attribute as defined by ARIA Section 5.4 Definition of Roles. The attribute, if specified, must have a value that is a set of space-separated tokens representing the various WAI-ARIA roles that the element belongs to. The WAI-ARIA role that an HTML element has assigned to it is the first non-abstract role found in the list of values generated when the role attribute is split on spaces. Code examples: A new role switch has been introduced in ARIA 1.1, for assistive technology that recognise the switch role it should be the role used to represent the semantics of the element, for those that don’t it should be ignored and the checkbox role should be recognised as representing the semantics of the element. <div tabindex=\"0\" role=\"switch checkbox\" aria-label=\"test\">test</div> Note: in browsers tested (latest versions of Chrome and Firefox on Windows 10) multiple role values are presented as such in the accessibility tree and the switch role is exposed correctly in iA2 with a role=”toggle button” Test cases: These include various permutations of abstract (landmark, section) roles and a landmark role main, as well as tests for the switch role. Note: the abstract roles are used ONLY for the purposes of testing implementations, as the ARIA spec states: Abstract roles are used for the ontology. Authors MUST NOT use abstract roles in content. See the Pen multiple role value tests by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen. Findings JAWS JAWS 16/Firefox 41 does not recognise the role of an element when abstract role values are placed prior to a recognised non abstract role, for example the following is reported as a ‘main region’: <div role=\"main landmark\" aria-label=\"test 3\">test 3</div> This is not reported as having any role. <div role=\"landmark main\" aria-label=\"test 2\">test 2</div> This is a JAWS bug. JAWS does not recognise the switch role and does not fallback to reporting as a checkbox. This is a JAWS bug. NVDA NVDA/Firefox 41 reports all test cases correctly: all main regions are recognised. switch role is recognised (really NVDA uses the iA2 role value exposed by browser, it doesn’t take note of the ARIA role) and reported as “toggle button”. Window Eyes Window Eyes 9.2/Firefox 41  only reports test 1 as a region, does not recognise any element semantics for multiple roles in tests 2-5. This is a Window Eyes bug. Reports test 6/7 as a checkbox, this is correct fallback behaviour as Window Eyes has not yet implemented support for the iA2 toggle button role exposed in the browser. VoiceOver on iOS Reports all test cases correctly: all main regions are recognised. switch role is not recognised, but test 6 reported with fallback role as “tick box”. Note: the iOS testing was not latest version (version prior).  Michiel Bijl reports the switch role is not implemented in iOS 9.02. VoiceOver on OSX Yosemite @ccwilcox reports VO supports all test cases correctly: all main regions are recognised. switch role is reported as “switch”. Suggestion Until screen readers such as JAWS and Window Eyes have fixed their bugs it may not be the best idea to use the role attribute with multiple values or to use the switch role. With thanks to my friend John Foliot for asking a question about use of multiple role values.    Comparison of ARIA roles exposed via MSAA and UI Automation in IE9  Posted on Wednesday, 23 February 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The Microsoft MSAA API cannot provide mapping for all ARIA roles as it does not have defined roles and properties for all those defined by The ARIA specification, the Microsoft UI Automation API can. UI automation provides exposure of all WAI-ARIA roles and properties via the ControlType and AriaRole properties.  Testing UI Automation AriaRole support The testing of IE9 shows no change in support compared to IE8, any changes in results are due to fixes in testing methodology. Testing of the AriaRole properties support requires the Windows 7 operating system and the use of an updated inspect tool, currently only available as part of the Windows 7 SDK. Results from initial testing show that all possible ARIA role values are correctly exposed via the UI automation AriaRole property, but the stated mapping of the ARIA roles to UI automation ControlType is incomplete.  I have also re-tested MSAA role mapping taking into account roles that Microsft documented as unsupported via MSAA:  44 out of 49 – Of the 49 WAI-ARIA role (excluding abstract roles) values that can be mapped to MSAA: Internet explorer 9.0.8080.16413 maps 44 correctly. 35 out of 50 – Of the 50 WAI-ARIA role (excluding abstract roles) values that can be mapped to UI automation ControlType: Internet explorer 9.0.8080.16413 maps 35 correctly. 59 out of 59 – Of the 59 WAI-ARIA role (excluding abstract roles) values that can be mapped via UI automation AriaRole property: Internet explorer 9.0.8080.16413 maps 59 correctly.

They add decoration and/or information to user interfaces. For screen reader users their inclusion can sometimes be annoying or confusing as the visual and aural user interface differ.   The term symbol in this case refers to UTF-8 symbols and related text characters used as symbols or icons. If symbols are included as a child of an interactive element such as a <button> or <a href…> their content will be used as part of the accessible name calculation for the interactive element. Why? because they are exposed in the HTML DOM, as text in modern browsers, even when they are included as CSS “content” , and text children of such elements are concatenated and used as the accessible name for the element, by browsers, regardless of their state (hidden or not), thus may be spoken by screen reader software. Update 20/2/2018 The cause of the announcement is not as I previously stated, it is due to  how Firefox have implemented support for aria-hidden, which results in hidden content being included in the accessible name Given the following: <button><span aria-hidden=\"true\">poot</span> Pat</button> Firefox exposes the label of the button as “poot Pat”. The aria-hidden text is present in the accessibility tree, but has an iA2 object attribute property of hidden=true  Chrome meanwhile, exposes the label of the button as “Pat” and does not include the hidden content in the accessibility tree.  there 2 Firefox bugs related to this behavior:  aria-hidden state not honoured with CSS generated content exclude aria-hidden=”true” elements from the tree  Thanks to Patrick Lauke and others for questioning the initial results and conclusions. The use of child text elements as part of the accessible name calculation in Firefox can be overridden by placing source for the accessible name on the button element itself: See the Pen Hiding symbols from screen readers by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.  Aside In the process of testing this issue I found that the announcement of UTF-8 symbols by screen readers is all over the place.

From the ARIA 1.0 specification: A grid is an interactive control [like a spreadsheet (for example)] A grid is considered editable unless otherwise specified. To make a grid read-only, set the aria-readonly attribute of the grid to true. gridcell (role) A cell in a grid or treegrid.  As such its use effects the behaviour of some AT; certain keystrokes are passed through to the browser and interaction instructions may be announced (For example the screen reader JAWS identifies a structure with role=grid as a “grid” not a “table”), use of aria-readonly=\"true\" can mitigate some of this. There is currently work going on for ARIA 1.1 to add role=table which will map directly to the HTML table element so it will be able to be used to create a custom table structure out of other elements. As always the best advice is use native HTML elements whenever possible.

       " 2: ' Inclusive Design Principles  Posted on Friday, 9 June 2017 by Henny Swan  Category: UX   Behind every great site or application lies thought, empathy and inclusion. This doesn’t happen by accident, it happens by design. How we get there is as unique, original, and diverse as the people who use our products. The Inclusive Design Principles are just one way to help you get there.  Why Inclusive Design Principles? Inclusive Design is about putting people first. It’s about designing for the needs of people with permanent, temporary, situational, or changing disabilities — all of us really. At TPG we wanted a framework which we could use, alongside the standards and guidelines, to take products beyond compliance. We work with people throughout the design, build, and evolution of a product including users, designers, architects, developers, product owners, strategists and more. These principles help ensure we identify the most appropriate features for a product, implemented in the best way possible, to support as many people as possible. As such the Inclusive Design Principles are not guidelines or a replacement for guidelines, they are prompts to be used during the design phase. The principles are:  Provide a comparable experience Consider situation Be consistent Give control Offer choice Prioritise content Add value  A full explanation of each principle can be found on the Inclusive Design Principles site. How to use the principles During the design phase, we need to do more than just ensure visual designs have sufficient colour contrast, visible focus states, logical structure and so on. We need to look at what features to include and how best to present these features from a visual design and interaction perspective. Let’s take an example such as a search feature and how we might apply a couple of the principles starting with Add value: Consider the value of features and how they improve the experience for different users. Imagine a native app for a streaming music or TV service. The search is predictive so people with dexterity issues or learning impairments can use the feature with more ease. Search results are also grouped under headings or for artists, albums and songs etc. This makes results easier to filter, scan, and navigate to for blind people using screen readers. So far so accessible – providing everything is coded correctly. Search results in the Sonos iOS app are grouped under tabs for Songs, Albums, Playlists and so on. To add value to the app, integrating with the Voice API supports people who find text input hard. This could include people with a screen reader, zoom, or with dexterity or learning impairments.  This value added feature is also an example of offering choice as some users may find voice search quicker and easier than text input: Consider providing different ways for people to complete tasks, especially those that are complex or non standard. By adding value and providing choice you make a search feature not only more inclusive but also more usable for people with situational or temporary limitations such as voice search when in a car or using a touch screen with a plaster on your finger. Inclusive design need not be a constraint. It’s the opposite; inclusive design is innovation and creatively. Translations Inclusion is about everybody so we’ll be adding as many language versions as possible. The Spanish version is available today, with more coming soon. Many thanks to Chaals McCathieNevile for the translations. Acknowledgements and inspiration There is so much good work out there that the Inclusive Design Principles build on such as the Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit, A Web for Everyone, , the Accessible UX Manifesto and more. But really it’s the people we build this stuff for that are the true contributors and inspiration. We also want to thank all those who provided feedback, suggestions and translations including Jamie Knight, Chris Mills, Glen Gordon, Marco Zehe, Ethan Marcotte, David Sloan, Melanie Richards, Tom Waterhouse, Matt Attkinson, Chaals McCathieNevile, Patrick Lauke, and Justin Stockton.

Slides Slides are available, a recording of the presentation at Inclusive Design 24 will follow soon.  TPG at W3C in 2016  Posted on Friday, 23 December 2016 by Steve Faulkner  Category: DevelopmentCategory: StandardsCategory: Strategy   The TPG partners Mike, Debs and Charlie have always placed an emphasis on developing and sharing knowledge on how to make the web more accessible for users. A major aspect of this is our continuing contributions to Web Standards at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  Here is some of the work we have been involved in @w3c in 2016:  Léonie Watson was elected to the W3C Advisory Board (AB), which  provides the W3C team with ongoing guidance on matters of strategy, policy, management, legal matters and conflict resolution. Léonie also notched up one year as co-chair of the Web Platform WG  Working with co-chairs Adrian Batemen (Microsoft) and Chaals McCathie Nevile (Yandex), we made progress on specifications including Gamepad API, IndexedDB API and Screen Orientation API. HTML5.1, Pointer Lock 1.0 and WebIDL Level 1 all became W3C Recommendations, and the First Public Working Draft (FPWD) of HTML5.2 was released.   Patrick Lauke became chair of the Pointer Events Working Group and co-editor of the Pointer Events specification Patrick worked with Henny Swan and Jeanne Spellman in the mobile a11y taskforce to submit new success criteria for WCAG 2.1 Jeanne Spellman and Sara Horton worked with Shawn Lauriat (Google) to form the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) Silver Task Force:  The objective of the task force is to perform preliminary development of a new version of Accessibility Guidelines following a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome. Code-named “Silver”, these guidelines will address the process of making content and functionality accessible to people with disabilities, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. These guidelines will address current technological and cultural web accessibility requirements and provide a base for continued evolution of the guidelines.   Michiel Bijil co-edited WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1  This document provides readers with an understanding of how to use WAI-ARIA 1.1  to create accessible rich internet applications.   Steve Faulkner spent another year co-editing HTML5, Notes on using ARIA in HTML, HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, and editing the ARIA in HTML specification. David Sloan is a member of the recently-formed Research Questions Task Force (RQTF) of the Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group. RQTF will be looking for answers to specific accessibility-related research questions provided by APA and W3C’s other working groups and task forces. In this work, we’ll also be providing research support to the WCAG Silver TF. David’s also co-chair, with Mary Ziegler of MIT, of the Accessible Online Learning Community Group (AccessLearn). The focus of AccessLearn is exploring how the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)’s resources can best serve the specific needs of people working to make sure that online learning experiences are as accessible as possible. To do this, we’ll be working closely with the Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG).   Windows High Contrast Mode: the limited utility of -ms-high-contrast  Posted on Monday, 12 December 2016 by Patrick H. Lauke  Category: Development   Internet Explorer and Edge have a vendor-prefixed -ms-high-contrast media feature which allows developers to detect if the user is currently in Windows High Contrast Mode, and to apply specific additional style rules in that situation. The media feature supports three values that can be tested: active, black-on-white and white-on-black. While on the face this feature seems pretty useful, it arguably provides authors with very little actionable information. Windows High Contrast Mode provides users with a selection of different ready-made high-contrast themes. For instance, in Windows 10 the user can choose between “High Contrast #1”, “High Contrast #2”, “High Contrast Black” and “High Contrast White”. In addition, users can redefine any of the colours used and save their own custom high contrast theme. Windows 10 High Contrast “Choose a theme” settings dialog Regardless of which specific colour scheme a user has chosen, -ms-high-contrast:active will evaluate to true when any of these high contrast themes are enabled. A simple -ms-high-contrast media feature test, showing that -ms-high-contrast:active evaluates to true when the “High Contrast #1” theme is chosen. However, authors have no indication of what kind of colour scheme the user has actually enabled, so it’s not really appropriate for them to try and force a particular colour (possibly with the addition of -ms-high-contrast-adjust:none) or to load alternative resources such as images with “pre-baked” colors. Most notably, authors can’t really infer that -ms-high-contrast:active means the default “light colours on dark background” (and then perhaps try to force single-colour elements to use a white foreground colour), as the user may well have a colour scheme that favors “dark colours on light background” instead. Naive example of using -ms-high-contrast-adjust:none to force a particular foreground colour when -ms-high-contrast:active is true– forcing a light colour (in this case pink) works fine if the user happens to have chosen a scheme with a dark background. The same naive example fails though if the user has chosen a high contrast theme with a light background colour – in this case, resulting in pink text on a white background. All authors can really do here is to ensure that their styles will “work well” in a high-contrast setting – and as so much of this will depend on all the (undocumented) changes that the operating system and the browser will make to the author’s CSS, there is really not a lot of mileage here beyond some of the more drastic changes such as avoiding the use of background images (which will not be rendered in high contrast modes in Internet Explorer) and instead making alternative visually hidden text for these images visible, if present. The values of white-on-black and black-on-white initially appear to overcome the shortcoming of active: not only does the author know that Windows High Contrast Mode is enabled, but they can also at least get an indication of the type of high contrast colour theme the user has chosen. So if -ms-high-contrast:white-on-black is active, they could introduce additional style rules (and force particular colours using -ms-high-contrast-adjust:none) that work well on a black background. The simple -ms-high-contrast media feature test, showing that -ms-high-contrast:white-on-black evaluates to true when a the default “High Contrast Black” theme is active. However, white-on-black and black-on-white are very specific values, and they depend entirely on whether or not the current high contrast theme uses pure white and pure black for the respective foreground/background colours. This is of course the case for the default “High Contrast Black” and “High Contrast White” themes. As users can customise the specific colours used by Windows High Contrast Mode themes, every time even a custom theme uses pure white for text and pure black for background, the related -ms-high-contrast:white-on-black will evaluate to true (and vice-versa for black-on-white). But as soon as a user/theme strays slightly from these very specific combinations, the queries return false. For instance, using pure white foreground text on a dark blue, rather than black, background results in -ms-high-contrast:white-on-black quite logically evaluating to false. As such, these two values are of limited use, and will only evaluate to true in very specific conditions. The simple -ms-high-contrast media feature test, showing that -ms-high-contrast:white-on-black does not evaluate to true if the high contrast theme has white foreground text on a custom dark blue background. In summary, while on the face the -ms-high-contrast media feature may look useful for authors, in practice the information that an author can get from querying this feature is limited (in the case of -ms-high-contrast:active) and only applicable in some very specific situations (for -ms-high-contrast:white-on-black and -ms-high-contrast:black-on-white).  How “invert brightness” can improve accessibility and help us use our devices  Posted on Friday, 22 December 2017 by Matthew Atkinson  Category: Development   This post continues our series looking at innovative assistive technologies. The last post discussed some novel techniques for personalising interfaces to their users and devices. This post discusses an adaptation that is much closer to making it to a device near you… As someone who is sensitive to light levels, I have often found features of software or devices that reduce the brightness of the screen to be helpful. A common means of doing this is via an “invert colours” feature, which flips the bits that make up the pixels on the screen, and you end up with a screen where all the colours are the opposite—white turns to black, light colours turn to dark colours. Altered meaning However there is a problem with this situation: it’s not just the brightness that is inverted; it’s the hues too. This makes makes all photos of people look like X-Rays (or like they’re being exterminated by Daleks), which may look cool at first glance, but really can distort our perception and ability to make sense of the images. It also changes the meanings of things: “everything’s OK” affirmative tick/check marks become pink, and red “danger/error” indicators become harmless light cyan/blue.     Invert brightness There are a few solutions to this problem. My first exposure to “invert brightness” was from a university research project that had a proof-of-concept filter that ran on Windows, though alas the website was lost to time. Fortunately, some mainstream assistive technologies provide this feature too, and whilst it sounds like “invert colours” it’s actually a world apart, because things look just-about right, having the same hue, but a different level of light. The tone of a graphic design, and the meanings of symbols, are not lost.  TPG web page (normal)   TPG web page with inverted colours   TPG web page with inverted brightness, but colours preserved  Android provides this feature (it actually calls it “colour inversion” though it is in fact doing the right thing and inverting the brightness!) and it would be great if other platforms could adopt it too. The only drawback of inverting brightness over the entire screen is that it doesn’t provide a fully natural solution for photographs—the sky being dark and the ground being light looks unusual, even if the colours are correct.  The best way around this is to simply leave photos as they are, but invert the brightness of the other areas of the screen. Current approaches for photographs Alas I’m not aware of any other platform that offers that combination of features.  Chrome has a High Contrast extension that leaves images as they are, whilst inverting the colours of other content on the page. Apple’s iOS 11 has a similar feature called “smart invert” that also leaves media alone and inverts the other colours on-screen. This does help a lot with images, but it’s still using colour, rather than brightness, inversion, for the rest of the screen, so the problems discussed above with altered design and meaning still apply, as the following images demonstrate.  BBC News article without brightness adjustment   BBC News article with classic “invert colours”   BBC News article with new “smart invert  (You may notice that in the “smart invert” scheme, the status bar text at the very top of the phone screen is kept white. This would have contrasted well with the original, red, branding at the top of the story, but is difficult to read against the colour-inverted, cyan, branding. Whilst it’s laudable that the smart invert approach has been created and continues to be developed, this reinforces the importance of inverting brightness over colour.) It would be great if Android’s brightness inversion could be combined with Chrome & Apple’s approach of leaving images out of the changes.  This would preserve the look and feel, and meaning, of a design, as well as keeping images accessible. Performance considerations There’s a reason why, historically, colour inversion has been used.  It’s because the value of any pixel is simply negated (which turns dark pixels light, and light pixels dark, as well as altering the colour).  This is a very quick operation for the CPU/GPU to perform, so is still efficient.  The problem comes because pixels use the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) colourspace, so simply flipping the value affects both colour and brightness, hence the problems described above.  Both the code and the computational effort are kept simple. The more apt solution of inverting only the brightness requires looking at the colour values in a different colourspace, such as Hue-Saturation-Luminance (HSL).  Doing this allows adjustment of the brightness/lightness whilst preserving the hue (the actual colour).  The challenge with this approach is that it is much more computationally expensive, because each pixel’s RGB value must be converted to HSL, be adjusted, and then be converted back to RGB, which would affect performance and battery life.  The traditional solution, when important operations are too slow slow on general-purpose CPUs and GPUs, is to create a specific hardware circuit to solve those problems.  This has been done to enable small devices such as phones and tablets to effortlessly decode high-resolution video, and perform encryption/decryption, for transmitting information securely.  However, the catch there is that creating custom hardware is extremely expensive, so it is only done when there’s no other alternative. It may be that some of the graphics hardware in devices these days can be used to alleviate some of the computational burden of inverting brightness—perhaps the emergence of this feature on Android, and the emergence of smart invert (for colours) on iOS means this is already happening, or simply that the trade-off of battery life in exchange for a dramatically improved experience for light-sensitive users is considered worth it.  Android flags this feature as experimental, so hopefully they are collecting some data on its performance to help tune it, and we’ll continue to be able to use it in future releases. There is another way that this problem could be solved, which may require slightly more design time up-front, but no extra processing: “dark mode”.  Several apps already provide a mode of operation for use in low-light environments that basically inverts the brightness of the screen, but this is done by the designers of the app having created that colour scheme for the UI and writing the code to apply it.  It’s often rumoured that iOS will eventually contain a global “dark mode” setting, and if so, Apple could provide the APIs and development tools to make it easy for app developers to support this.  On recent Android releases, the launcher UI adapts to differing light levels, so it’s possible this too could be extended to apps once the API has matured. In closing The general, CPU-hungry solution is empowering to users because they can apply it to any app or website, so it is valuable and should be made more widely available on all platforms.  However, it would be great if developers were to be given improved APIs by those platforms in order to create alternative UI themes, as this would be considerably more efficient, and would generally raise awareness and consideration of how light levels can affect UIs and users. These are exciting times for assistive technologies; the future’s bright (or otherwise, as we users see fit).

The paper appears in W4A 2016 Proceedings of the 13th Web for All Conference, Copyright © 2016 ACM. Introduction Ensuring the accessibility to students with disabilities of online learning experiences is widely recognised as a socially and legally significant objective. Any successful program with an objective of producing accessible learning experiences will need to address elements closer to the surface, including:  Platforms: Can students with disabilities access and use the content and features provided by the software platform? Resources: Is the content and functionality of the learning materials accessible and usable and understandable? Assessments: Can learners with disabilities demonstrate mastery of the subject matter in a way that is authentic and comprehensive?  Many efforts are underway in the educational technology sector, as well as in individual institutions, to raise levels of accessibility, in particular activities aimed at improving accessibility of learning management systems (LMS) (see for example, Gay et al., 2009). However, in addition to the learning management system, online learning accessibility applies to learning resources, the quality of the process used to acquire and provide them, and how instructors use them to deliver learning experiences. The academic context—the learning objectives of the experience, and the baseline knowledge expected of learners—adds a unique challenge to defining what is an appropriate accessible experience. Additionally, like all digital experiences, an effective accessibility solution is partly dependent on the extent to which someone with accessibility needs has an available solution that will allow them to access and interact with the digital resource. When an education provider prioritises a strategy of accommodation, individual learner needs may be met, but inaccessible aspects of the underlying learning experience remain unaddressed. With the emergence of remote learning, where a learner may never visit a physical campus, there is less opportunity for an institution to provide the learner with a particular technology setup, and therefore there is less scope to make design decisions based on assumptions about a student’s available technology. Often, accessibility activity is reactive. Education providers may be responding to actual or threatened legal action relating to disability discrimination. These efforts instinctively focus on evaluating existing digital systems against accessibility standards, with the intention of remediating barriers that are found. This approach is inefficient, as it often places significant burden on a few individuals. It is also often unsuccessful, for example when the technical nature of the barriers found means that a system cannot reasonably be remediated, or when a resource is provided by a third-party supplier and the institution is unable to make any changes to it. In short, an accessibility strategy based on accommodation and remediation is not sufficient to effectively meet student rights to accessible and equitable education, and to provide a good experience for learners who have disabilities. Accessibility must be infused into organizational culture and practice, particularly in key areas such as organizational leadership, policy, and resource procurement. Accessibility can be further supported by introducing new processes and services that make accessibility more readily achievable. In this position paper we propose foundational activities related to culture and practice that bolster more direct efforts to provide accessible online learning experiences. The Value of Masterplanning Most public organizations, including schools and universities, have a facility masterplan that defines current resources and maps out plans for growth and change over time. The masterplan reflects the goals and aspirations of the organization and supports its long-term strategic vision. The strategic masterplan exposes relationships and dependencies, to show how change in one area influences options in others. When guided by a masterplan, activities and initiatives harmonize across the institution. Organizations that are required to provide accessible facilities will include accessibility as a required attribute of all programs and facilities. Because accessibility is drawn into the masterplan and considered in all facets of the environment, campus activities are more likely to be accessible to people with disabilities. As accessibility consultants, we often work with clients in the education sector—colleges and universities, publishers, software companies. Our primary offering has historically been audits of existing software against accessibility standards. When we work on auditing LMSes, we see a clear delineation between responsibility for the content and functionality provided by people who design and develop the tool and the content and functionality provided by people who use the tool—including instructors. However, through engagements with a number of universities on providing strategic accessibility consultancy, we know resolving accessibility issues with LMS software is only a small piece of the puzzle, and in some ways the most straightforward to resolve. The real challenge lies in harmonizing all activities in the digital classroom such that accessibility is a required attribute of all contributions. A masterplanning approach to a digital campus accessibility strategy encourages a holistic view of the way in which the digital campus evolves—strategies and activities, internal and external stakeholders, standards and practice—and how each of these can play a role in positively influencing accessibility. Masterplanning the Digital Campus The digital campus is much less planned than the physical campus, and many more individuals have a hand in its composition—in creating it and changing it (Welchman, 2015). Given that the web has its origins in education and the devolved nature of most educational institutions, especially at higher education level, it is unsurprising that most organizations involved in online learning have largely unplanned digital estates. This is problematic, as a lack of structure and coordination makes governance and implementation of online accessibility more difficult to achieve. Institutions implementing a long-term and sustainable digital accessibility strategy must work to create a more planned digital campus. Who masterplans? A feature of an immature approach to accessibility is isolated subject-matter experts and advocates, who may be highly knowledgeable in accessibility, and skilled in diagnosing and remediating issues; but who have little to no voice or influence in institution-wide strategy and activity. This situation betrays a reactive, remediation approach to accessibility; when problems with process are never addressed, the result is that these informal champions may see their work as never-ending and unrewarding, and may become disillusioned over time with a lack of progress or attention. The institution thus loses its domain experts but retains ineffective practices and exposes itself to potential unlawful discriminatory practice. For accessibility to have visibility and influence requires support from leadership, and a genuine recognition of the value of including accessibility as a core quality of the institution’s activity (Kline, 2011). Masterplanning naturally forms part of the responsibilities of an institutional accessibility initiative, led by an accessibility lead and supported by a group of influential staff who have authority and responsibility for accessibility as a quality attribute of the digital campus. This core accessibility leadership group should have sufficient representation from across campus to have a clear understanding of the diversity of culture and practice, and the practical challenges that will need to be met when masterplanning an accessibility initiative. Focus accessibility masterplanning on online learning Masterplanning accessibility into an entire digital campus can be a major undertaking. Online learning provides a good target for accessibility planning, with opportunities to enhance the quality of the learning environment, widen access to a greater number of learners, and where there are potential legal ramifications to inaction or insufficient action. Accessible online learning provides an opportunity to put structures in place to support accessibility across the organization. For accessible online learning, digital resources that are used to support teaching and learning must be prioritized. Educational organizations should have no difficulty making a case for prioritizing online learning resources, if only for the sake of minimizing risk. Many countries have clear laws protecting the rights of students with disabilities to education, and education providers have found themselves subject to legal inquiry due to perceived discrimination against disabled students due to digital accessibility barriers. For many organizations, risk mitigation can provide the motivation and resources needed to prioritize accessibility in the online learning context. Foundations of Accessible Online Learning Accessible online learning experiences arise from an integrated, mature approach to accessibility. Masterplanning should look at key activity areas: policy, process, programs and practice. POLICY Educational organizations must establish which standards will be used to benchmark accessibility, and which digital products and services are required to comply with the standard. Policy establishes and articulates the priorities and obligations of the digital campus. Set an accessibility standard for digital learning resources Education providers must have a clear definition of and policy around accessibility. The policy must set a target standard and level of accessibility, such as the W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA. The policy must both define a minimum acceptable level of user experience for people with disabilities and preserve academic rigor for online learning materials. An effective accessibility policy will be future-focused, encouraging activities around new digital resources rather than existing resources in need of remediation. It will encourage replacement or retirement of resources that are difficult or impossible to repair. A realistic accessibility policy will not require full compliance with accessibility standards. There are far too many variables that affect accessibility to aim for an online learning environment that is fully and completely compliance with accessibility standards. Instead, the policy should seek to minimize accessibility issues in digital resources, understand accessibility issues that remain, and have a plan of action for how to address them. Include an exception procedure An exception procedure describes what must happen when a resource or tool is found to be non-conformant with the standard and what should happen when it is considered impractical or impossible to achieve conformance. Replacement or retirement options should be considered before persisting with a resource that does not meet the specified standard. If the digital resource is vital to delivery of learning experiences, accessibility issues must be documented, along with a plan for managing accommodations for people who encounter issues using the service, and providers must seek ways to address outstanding issues. Establish accountability for policy compliance In most online learning offerings, implementing and enforcing an accessibility policy will require a partnership among different groups based on a shared understanding of roles and responsibilities. That said, the effort will be most successful if someone takes an accessibility leadership role. A leader and subject matter expert can set direction and communicate expectations around the policy, monitor compliance, and be accountable for the success of the effort (Welchman, 2015). PROCESS The foundational software and resources that comprise online learning environments are generally acquired rather than built. Vendors contributing to the digital campus must meet accessibility requirements, and organizations must have the means to evaluate accessibility in products and services. Include accessibility in resource procurement Most online learning offerings are composed in some part of tools, platforms, and content that are procured by the sponsoring organization. In these cases, implementing accessibility is not a matter of training designers and developers, but rather asking the right questions in the procurement process. Procurement of systems, tools and resources may take place centrally, or be devolved. With centralisation, there is greater control over the application of a procurement policy, but in many institutions, there will be significant devolution of procurement to faculty. This means that masterplanning must promote the value of following the accessible procurement policy, and the articulate the risks of not doing so. Establish a documentation standard Documenting accessibility is a vital part of policy implementation. Using a standard template, such as a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, or VPAT®, can help to ensure consistency in scope and reporting. In procurement initiatives, there will likely be situations where no supplier can deliver a product or service to the required level of accessibility. The exception procedure that partners with the accessibility standard must provide guidance on assessing the implications of adopting a solution that is sub-standard in terms of accessibility, and dealing appropriately with any issues that arise. Longer term, aligning institutional accessibility policies across the educational sector will help institutions articulate their accessibility demands in a more uniform way to suppliers. In turn, this may increase the chances that suppliers take steps to meet market demand by improving accessibility accordingly. PROGRAMS Centralized and coordinated accessibility programs can provide the right resources at the right time. Developing a solid supporting service layer will make it easier for course providers to deliver accessible online learning. Establish accessibility services and resources Many accessibility activities require doing things differently, not necessarily doing something additional, while others require additional effort and time. Establishing centralized services to support accessible online learning will require an initial investment, but will reduce the outlay overall. For example, media accessibility requires additional time and effort, with investment required to create an equivalent version of the information, such as captions for the audio in course videos. In this case, a central caption provisioning service that is integrated into the process of posting videos will help produce content that is accessible to all learners. Consolidate decentralized programs and services Crosscutting initiatives like accessibility are difficult to accomplish when different groups are responsible for delivering the same programs and services. Generally speaking, the effort of building accessibility awareness and skills and maintaining a common understanding over time is more difficult with decentralized services. When laying the foundations for accessible online learning, strive to centralize programs and services that support online learning to the greatest extent possible. PRACTICE The arguments for accessibility of online learning experiences are widely espoused, and there is increasing agreement that accessibility is an important quality of an online learning experience. The construction and delivery of an online learning experience is a complex task that may involve many stakeholder groups. For a successful, accessible online experience, each stakeholder group must recognise and meet its responsibilities. Understand policies and obligations Accessibility requirements vary around the world, as do support resources and accommodations available to students with disabilities. Responsibility for supporting students with disabilities in the online context may be different from supporting on-campus students. Responsibilities may differ for courses that are offered free of charge and course that are offered for a fee. Understanding policy on supporting students with disabilities helps establish the impact on responsibilities for accommodating students with disabilities in online courses. Identify who is responsible for assisting students with disabilities Many educational organizations provide support services for students who have disabilities, such as note-takers, real-time captioning, and document conversion. A masterplan establishes who is responsible for providing support for students with disabilities and the level of support provided for online courses. Some organizations will provide some support through student services and other support through information technology services—for example, help using learning management systems with assistive technology. Inject accessibility into teaching methods As the primary providers of learning experiences, instructors have a critical role to play in the accessibility of the digital campus. Instructors are contributors of digital assets, whether through creating or modifying them, or commissioning or procuring them from third parties. Therefore, they must be aware of institutional standards and best practice in designing or selecting accessible digital content. Teaching practice also influences the accessibility of the learning experience, whether in a classroom or online. An awareness of inclusive teaching practices recognises learner diversity and different learning styles, which may be influenced by accessibility requirements (CAST, 2011). An instructor’s practice can also impact on effort required to ensure digital accessibility at a more fine-grained level. Take, for example, an instructor whose lectures are captured on video, which will be captioned and transcribed and made available to learners. If the instructor applies inclusive teaching practice, when using visual aids such as graphics projected onto a screen visible to the class she will also describe orally the key information available in each graphic. This oral description can also be captured in the transcript. If the instructor were to assume that the visual aids were accessible to all of the class, there would be additional burden on the transcriber to generate a description of the salient points of the visual aid, which might require additional input from the instructor. The use of un-described visuals adds to the effort required to create an accessible equivalent of the lecture. Therefore, masterplanning needs to include a focus on the professional practice of instructors, to ensure that inclusive teaching is a recognised core skill. Integration of digital resources in the learning experience must cover ensuring resources are optimally accessible, while also applying best practice in inclusive teaching methods. Recruitment, promotion schemes and professional development programs can serve as places to reinforce the value of inclusive teaching. Build an accessibility “Community of Practice” Communities of practice can be powerful aids to increasing the profile of accessibility as a cross-campus quality, and to support sharing of accessibility knowledge and experiences amongst digital content creators in a supportive and positive way. Masterplanning might focus on activities such as:  establishing accessibility champions within academic and central organisations as points of contact and sources of information relating to accessibility, and ensuring these champions are kept up-to-date with institutional strategy and activity relating to accessibility; supporting the establishment of regular cross-campus informal gatherings focused on discussing aspects of inclusive design; encouraging networking between domain experts in accessibility related topics, such as web development, disabilities studies and human-computer interaction, and faculty and institution-wide accessibility strategy and practice; encouraging engagement with local accessibility communities of practice, such as accessibility meetups, or virtually, such as the Viking and the Lumberjack series of accessibility videocasts.  Building on Foundations for Lasting Change A masterplanning approach provides a way for a more strategic approach to improving inclusive online learning experiences, by looking holistically at an educational organisation’s policies and practices, processes, and assets—human and technical. We suggest this approach as one that we have encouraged amongst higher education organisations we have worked with. Implementation is a long and slow process, and it will take time to evaluate its impact. What might success metrics for a masterplanning approach include? In the case of the University of Colorado at Boulder, one early and positive outcome of their strategic accessibility work was the closing of a legal inquiry into unlawful discrimination by the Department of Justice. Another possible success measure would be a greater number of learners with disabilities successfully completing educational programs. At a more specific level, we might look to measure things like changes in baseline awareness of accessibility across staff, application of inclusive teaching methods, and accessibility of digital resources and tools. Another critical consideration for the future of organisational capacity to deliver accessibility is raising awareness of accessibility as a digital literacy and as a specialty. How well are we teaching accessibility as a subject in our educational programs, and preparing the next wave of stakeholders—the software designers and engineers, educators, instructional designers, student support providers, librarians—to provide an environment that supports delivery of accessible online learning? Education providers themselves have a responsibility in this area, but two initiatives are underway to explore these topics in depth:  Teaching Accessibility, an initiative of a consortium of organisations from industry, education and disability advocacy to raise baseline expectations for accessibility skills amongst new hires, and to correspondingly raise the profile of accessibility in educational curricula: teachingaccessibility.com.

Short note on accommodating the users display preferences on iOS  Posted on Friday, 13 April 2018 by Peter Heery  Category: DevelopmentCategory: UX Tag: iOS   A characteristic of thoughtful, inclusive, design is to give control to users to interact with content in their preferred way.  When approaching application (app) design, we must include stories and requirements for accessibility. We should incorporate feedback from people with access needs, and follow technical accessibility best practices where applicable. But to enhance a (hopefully) already good user experience, we should also consider adding requirements for our app to respond to a user’s preferences in their device accessibility settings. Letting users interact with content in their preferred way will enhance the user experience, and can really help with any permanent, temporary, or situational accessibility challenges they may face. User preferences to support in your app design iOS provides several display customisations and font adjustments to allow a user to control how they interact with content. We’ll be focusing on the following display customisations that are available through the iOS Accessibility API.  Reduce transparency – This setting allows a user to reduce or remove the background transparency of UI (User Interface) elements that are otherwise implemented using semi-transparent backgrounds. Reduce motion – This setting allows a user to turn off or reduce motion effects on UI elements. Bold text – This setting allows a user to make fonts heavier. This option will make thin, hard-to-see font lines thicker, and easier to see.  What follows are some examples of how you might choose to use display accommodations as requirements to enhance your design. Example: Adding “Reduce transparency” into your design requirements For some people with low vision, or for someone experiencing vision challenges in bright sunlight, UI elements with solid backgrounds will be easier to read. Adding in a requirement to allow a user control to reduce or completely remove this visual effect could look like this:  Design: Include design variations for transparent and opaque backgrounds on UI elements. Development: Determine if the user has enabled “Reduce Transparency” by checking the state of the UIAccessibilityIsReduceTransparencyEnabled() boolean. Update the UI accordingly. Development: Determine if the user has adjusted the “Reduce Transparency” setting whilst using the app by listening for a notification from the UIAccessibilityReduceTransparencyStatusDidChange global variable. Update the UI accordingly.  Reduced transparency in the iOS Control Centre The iOS Control Centre provides a good example of accommodating the users preference for reduced transparency.  Through thoughtful design, a user can opt to increase the legibility of the control centre by enabling the “Reduce Transparency” setting. You can test this yourself by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > Increase Contrast > Reduce Transparency.  Reduce transparency disabled Reduce transparency enabled Example: Adding “Reduce motion” into your design requirements Screen transitions, some types of animation, and zoom and parallax effects can cause some people to feel dizzy, nauseous or experience motion sickness when using a UI. In some scenarios, users may want to turn off motion effects in order to prolong their battery life. Adding a requirement to allow a user control to minimise or remove those motion effects could look like this:  Design: Include variations for both cross dissolve and sliding in of new views. (A cross dissolve doesn’t make use of any motion). Development: Determine if the user has enabled “Reduce Motion” by checking the state of the   UIAccessibilityIsReduceMotionEnabled() boolean. Update the UI accordingly. Development: Determine if the user has adjusted the “Reduce Motion” setting whilst using the app by listening for a notification from the UIAccessibilityReduceMotionStatusDidChange global variable. Update the UI accordingly.  Reduce motion in the iOS Weather app The screen recording below shows the “city list” view in the iOS weather app. Each city listed (Nottingham, Dublin, Palma, Belfast, Mormugao and Barcelona) shows the current time and temperature in the foreground text. Each city has an animated background of the sky to visually to represent the current weather there. For example, Nottingham has some thick, fast moving clouds against a dull grey sky, Mormugao shows a clear night sky with shooting stars, whilst Barcelona shows slow moving white clouds in a clear bright blue sky.  This type of multi-speed movement may trigger nausea or motion sickness for some. Through thoughtful, inclusive design, a user can opt out of this experience by enabling the “Reduce Motion” setting. You can test this yourself by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion.   https://developer.paciellogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ios-Weather-motion.m4v Related information  Responsive Design for Motion  Example: Adding “Bold text” to your design requirements Reading light ultra-thin fonts on small screens can be challenging for lots of people, especially those with visual impairments, but even those who do not consider themselves to have a visual impairment. Adding a requirement to allow a user control to switch to a bold or semi-bold font could look like this:  Design: Include designs for standard ultra-thin font and a bold font variant. Development: Determine if the user has enabled “Bold Text” by checking the state of the UIAccessibilityIsBoldTextEnabled() boolean. Update the UI accordingly.  Bold text in the iOS weather app The iOS weather app provides a good example of accommodating the users preference for bold text.  Through thoughtful design, a user can opt to increase the legibility of the on-screen text by enabling the “Bold Text” setting. You can test this yourself by going to Settings > General > Accessibility > Bold Text.  Bold text disabled Bold text enabled Testing visual accommodations In addition to testing on an actual device, ‘Reduce Transparency’ and ‘Reduce Motion’ can be also tested using the new Accessibility Inspector in Xcode – see WWDC 2016 – Auditing Your Apps for Accessibility. At the time of writing, both ‘Bold text’ and ‘Darken Colors’ need to be tested on an actual device. Summary Adding appropriate display accommodations can enhance the user experience for a range of users with permanent, temporary, or situational accessibility challenges. Display accommodations should not be used to fix a defective design. We should use them to enhance an already good user experience by giving control to users, allowing them to interact with content in their preferred way.

Roger Hudson on the evolving web and Webstock interviews  Posted on Sunday, 30 March 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Standards   Roger Hudson a friend and esteemed colleague, has taken time to write a thought provoking essay: The Evolving Web – A Pace Layering view of the development of the Web and the W3C.  SUMMARY The Web today is very different to what it was in 1994, when the World Wide Web Consortium was established. This article looks back at the early history of the Web and uses Pace Layering theory to consider some recent developments and the role of the W3C in the process of change. Perhaps the Membership and structure of the W3C, which were highly effective in establishing the Web during its first decade, are no longer able to adequately reflect the diverse interests and aspirations of the greatly increased number of Web users today. Also, perhaps it is time for the W3C to break away from its financial dependence on large corporate Members and to start taking a more active role in regulating the Web. This article draws on the keynote presentation “Web 2.0 and the Concept of Universal Design” by Roger Hudson and Russ Weakley at the OzeWAI Conference in December 2007. He has also made available from his site, the recent interviews he conducted with Shawn Henry and Molly Holzschlag. Thank you Roger!  US Access Board to Release Pre-Draft of New Section 508/255 Standards  Posted on Monday, 20 July 2009 by Mike Paciello  Category: News Tag: 508   Received the following email from Tim Creagan at the US Access Board. Finally!! “This is the latest status update for you on the progress of the refresh of the 508 standards.” During the Access Board public meeting on Friday, July 17, 2009, the co-chairs of the ICT Ad Hoc Committee, Mr. Neil Melick and Mr. Ron Gardner, made the following motion: “IT is moved that the Access Board publish a Notice of Availability of a draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register along with a mini-preamble, and that a 90 day comment period be provided. At least one public comment period will be held during the comment period.” The Board passed the motion unanimously. What this means is that once the ICT Ad Hoc Committee completes the draft text and mini-preamble, to the satisfaction of the Board, a notice will appear in the Federal Register that draft text is available on the Access Board website for review and public comment. This is a step BEFORE a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). The Notice of Availability is being provided in the interest of getting material out to the public in a timely manner. The Notice of Availability allows draft text to be released. After public comments are received and reviewed, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will then be released, after preparation of a regulatory assessment, as well as a full Preamble. It is expected that the Notice of Availability will be released sometime in the fall of 2009.”  A Tale of Two Rooms: Understanding screen reader navigation  Posted on Thursday, 25 January 2018 by Ryan Jones  Category: Development    For those of us who use screen reading software such as JAWS, NVDA, or VoiceOver to access information on the Web, the user experience can be quite different from those who can visually see the content. One of my goals throughout the many accessibility focused training classes I have led has been to help others more accurately understand what it is like for someone using screen reading software to navigate through a web page.  French translation: Il était une fois 2 pièces: comprendre la navigation avec un lecteur d’écran by Damien Pobel.  It is common place for most people to want to jump straight into the technical details:  What keystrokes do I press? Which screen reader should I test with? What browser should I use?  While these are all important considerations, it is best to first step back and ask: What is the experience like and how can I simulate that experience if I can see the screen? To that end, I would like to present several illustrations that have been effective for communicating answers to these questions. An open door Let’s set the stage for our first illustration. Imagine you have just opened a door and are looking into a large conference room. In the center of the room is a large conference table with 10 chairs (5 on each side of the table). Seated at the table are 2 men and 2 women. All 4 people are seated at the same side of the table (they are facing the door you are standing at). On the far side of the room (behind the people seated at the table) are 3 large windows that look out over a courtyard with benches, flowers, and small trees. On the right side of the room is a counter with a coffee pot and microwave sitting on it. The left side of the room has a large flat screen television mounted on the wall. Assuming you are not already familiar with the layout of this room, what is the first thing you would do upon opening the door? Some of you might visually scan the room from left to right. Some might scan from right to left. Others might first look at the table in the center and then scan the perimeter of the room. No matter how you do it though, most of you would in some way scan the room with your eyes to get a quick sense of the layout and contents of the room. The scan might only take a couple of seconds and most of you won’t even realize you did it. You might then focus in on certain elements of interest such as the people sitting at the table or the large flat screen television. A darkened room Now, let’s re-imagine the scene and this time when you open the door, the room is completely dark. No light is present and you can see absolutely nothing at first glance. You have been given a small flashlight though and when you switch it on, the light allows you to see a small area at a time. The area you can see is a small circle about 2 feet in diameter and nothing outside that circle is illuminated. How would you now observe the contents of the room? Some of you might move the light back and forth from left to right starting at your feet and moving away from you. Some of you might start from the back of the room and move the light toward you while others might randomly point the light at various places in the room with no particular pattern. As you move the light around the room you will need to build a mental map or image of what is in the room and how it is laid out. Building this mental map will take significantly longer than visually scanning the room when all the lights were on. As you move the flashlight around, you will need to remember each thing you have seen and how they all relate together. If you forget where something is located, it will take more time to locate it. Was the counter with the coffee pot on the right side of the room or was it in the back? How many people were sitting at the table? Was it 4 or 5?  Answering these questions when you can see the entire room at once will take little effort but answering them when you can only see a small area at a time will take much longer. An analogous scenario This second scenario is analogous to how a screen reader user reviews a web page or smartphone app. While keyboard commands or touch gestures can move the screen reading software around the page, it is only possible to read one thing at a time. There is no way for the visually impaired user to get a quick (1 to 3 second) overview of the page similar to what someone who can see the screen might do. Fortunately, if accessible page navigation techniques such as headings or regions are used, this can help the screen reader user focus in on certain areas of the page.  Stepping back to our dark room scenario from above, imagine there are now small red dots of light on key elements in the room such as the table, counter, television, and each person sitting at the table. You still have to use the flashlight to look around, but the red dots give you an idea of where the most important things might be located. Another significant challenge that screen reader users may face is dynamically changing content on a page. Returning to our light and dark room examples from above, pretend that one of the men gets up and moves to the other side of the table. There are now 2 women and 1 man on one side of the table and 1 man on the other side. In the lit room example, you would most likely notice the movement as it happens. Even if you weren’t looking directly at the man who moved, you would probably notice movement out of the corner of your eye and then turn to see what was happening. In our dark room scenario it would be very difficult to know that anything happened unless you happened to have the flashlight beam directly on the man who moved at the exact right time. It is more likely you would never know he moved until sometime later when you happen to move the light over the chair he vacated. This in effect is what happens when page content changes but does not alert screen reading software. The user may never know that something changed on the page unless they happen to move across the new information and realize that it is now different. This challenge is best solved by ensuring the dynamic content uses techniques such as alerts or live regions which cause the screen reading software to announce the updated information to the user.  In our dark room scenario above, the man might verbally announce that he is moving from one side of the table to the other. Even if your light wasn’t on him, you would hear the announcement and better understand what is changing. In one final illustration let’s take the windows that look out to the courtyard. In the lighted room scenario you would be able to quickly see that the windows face a courtyard with benches, flowers, and trees. In the dark room example though, even if you pointed the light at the windows, you would not be able to see what was outside. This illustrates visual elements such as images that do not have a text label associated with them. For example, screen reading software can identify that an image is present on a page but the only way it can communicate information about the image is through the alternative text label that can be assigned. Without the text label, the screen reader user would have no idea what the image is showing. In our dark room example, a sign might be placed next to the windows with a description of what appears outside. When you locate the windows with your light, you would then be able to read the sign. Better understanding One of the best ways to better understand the screen reader user experience is to try it yourself. It is certainly advantageous to try using screen reading software on your own to navigate web page content. In addition though, here is a simple exercise you can do to simulate the scenarios illustrated above. (I don’t recommend finding random conference rooms with people in them and turning out all the lights!)  Print out a paper copy of a web page. I recommend one that is not too large but contains a variety of elements such as text, links, menus, etc. Find a blank sheet of paper and make a small hole in the center of it. The hole should be about the size of 2 or 3 words (around a half inch in diameter is usually sufficient). Place the paper with the hole in it over the printout of the web page and try making sense of what is there. Slide the paper with the hole in it around in order to read the contents of the web page print out below.  It will probably be very difficult and time consuming to understand what is on the page but this gives you a general idea of what it is like for a screen reader user (especially if no page navigation techniques are used).  Access Board Announces Section 508/Section 255 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  Posted on Wednesday, 17 March 2010 by Mike Paciello  Category: Strategy   At long last! The US Access Board today announced the Section 508/255 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. A 90-day comment period follows. Please refer to the US Access Board web site for additional details.  Inclusive Design Principles: Be Consistent  Posted on Friday, 11 August 2017 by Heydon  Category: StrategyCategory: UX   This article is one in a series of articles on The Paciello Group blog aimed at unpacking each of the Inclusive Design Principles. This time the principle is Be Consistent. Look out for the others. Such is the power of consistency in design that I’ve taken to saying, “I don’t mind if it’s bad, so long as it’s consistently bad.” And I’m only half joking. An interface that’s a grab-bag of ideas, some good and some bad, may show signs of potential but its very inconsistency is its ultimate failure. Whereas, at least a persistently poor interface is somewhat predictable. Sometimes users get accustomed to your poor implementations, so much so that it causes confusion when they’re replaced. It doesn’t matter if the new solution is easier to use; it’s something different that has to be learned, and that’s painful.  There are two dimensions to consistency that need considering when building an interface. Let’s deal with these in turn.  Internal consistency External consistency  Internal consistency Internal consistency is all about an interface’s success at being consistent with itself. An exercise some organizations interested in building a pattern library undertake is to first create an inventory of existing patterns. Invariably, there turns out to be more patterns (solutions) than problems. “Why have we got seventeen different button styles?” If things look (or sound, or feel) different to one another, users expect them to be different — to behave differently, belong to different mechanisms, and to achieve different ends. That is, inconsistent design makes interfaces seem more complex than they are. To a user, “seems complex” and “is complex” are indistinguishable. The problem of inconsistency affects all types of users, but can be experienced differently. A sighted user may have trouble unpicking the visual complexity of an interface, while a blind user may find that complexity echoed in the poor underlying structure their assistive technology software has to navigate. Consistency shouldn’t just be between discrete elements, but the larger mechanisms employed for users to achieve tasks. Two different parts of a website may offer the opportunity to search two different catalogues of content. But the search mechanism itself needn’t come in two distinct designs. Whether you’re searching books or audio books, search is still search. Often, large organizations divide themselves into separate development teams. This could lead, for example, to the books and audio books departments designing their own search interfaces. Not only does this mean more code being written and maintained but you’re asking users to learn two interfaces rather than just one, for no good reason. Of course, the principle should apply not just between different sections of the same interface, but between whole platform-specific versions of that interface. Amazon should be commended for the consistency of their search between desktop and iOS: if you enter a search term on desktop you get exactly the same categories of search suggestions there as on iOS.  The desktop version of the application may be used in the office, while the iOS version may be used at home. These changes in situation shouldn’t mean arbitrarily needing to adjust to different experiences. (This speaks to the complementary Consider situation principle.) It’s important organizations have style guides and pattern libraries that are shared between departments. Each pattern in the pattern library should be the singular solution to a particular, organization-wide problem. The main purpose of a pattern library is to uphold consistency. External consistency No interface exists in a vacuum. It’s informed by the culture of interface design to which it belongs. External consistency means consistency with patterns external to your own work, belonging to the wider discipline of interface design. Solutions become conventions and later traditions that form part of our shared language of digital communication and interaction. We all drink from that well. Just as in natural language, the language of interaction evolves over time as new “words” (patterns) are coined and old ones fall out of favor. Say what you like about the “hamburger menu” but it didn’t come out of nowhere. As a designer, you may even innovate something new from time to time that takes off. But it’s important we speak the same language, and that we heed consensus when it comes to the formulation of conventional interface elements. A big part of this is ensuring that what appears familiar behaves as expected. For example, what appears to be a conventional tab interface should adopt the keyboard behaviors that have come to the web platform from desktop. If you are not sure what these behaviors are, you can often consult the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices site. Interfaces that break too many rules may win design awards, but they’ll also alienate users. As a rule of thumb, users should be able to look at any part of your interface and think, “I’ve seen something like this before”. Not exactly like it, but like it. Navigation should look like your navigation, but not be mistaken for anything other than navigation. Forms should look like your forms, but they should have everything one would expect forms to have. Your footer should contain your contact details and, consistent with other people’s footers, should be found where footers go: at the foot. We can’t help that users bring preconceptions to interfaces. You need to find out what those preconceptions are, and when to accommodate or challenge them. Most of the time users aren’t looking for a fresh and challenging interface, but fresh and challenging content delivered in an expected and consistent way. A full explanation of each principle can be found on the Inclusive Design Principles site or in the related blog posts below:  Provide a comparable experience Consider situation Be consistent Give control Offer choice Prioritise content Add value   TPG at the W3C Web of Things Plugfest, March 2018  Posted on Tuesday, 24 April 2018 by Graeme Coleman  Category: ConferencesCategory: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   I recently attended the Spring 2018 edition of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) PlugFest in Prague, the Czech Republic (or Czechia, if you will). This event formed part of the wider 2018 W3C Web of Things IG/WG joint F2F meeting, sponsored by Siemens, held during the last week of March. It was my first time attending a Web of Things event (and indeed any form of W3C event!), but my initial trepidation was quickly overcome by thoughts of how much of what I saw could be applied within an accessibility context – and the potential for future accessibility research and application within this rapidly expanding area. The PlugFest itself was sponsored by Oracle, and hosted in their Czechia office a few miles west of downtown Prague. Aside from a small number of minor teething problems one would expect when trying to get multiple networked devices to talk to each other in a single room, the organizers did a fantastic job ensuring we were all set up, helped to ensure everything was working, and we were well fed and watered throughout the day – so I’d personally like to thank them for that! In this post, I will summarize my experience of the PlugFest – for a more complete overview, I encourage you to check out the full minutes for the W3C WoT F2F which cover not only the PlugFest, but other activities and events that occurred over the course of the week. What is a PlugFest? The purpose of WoT PlugFests is to bring together representatives from various industrial, commercial and academic organizations in a semi-formal environment, who then put together proof-of-concept demonstrations based upon the current specifications. To this end, tables were strewn with network cables, hubs, virtual assistants, speakers, webcams, and slightly quirky objects such as lamps and other household objects. Participants then spent their time putting together thing “mashups” to view/control one or more of these different devices based on their thing description (TD). It certainly is a surprising experience when the (network connected) lamp on the table in front of you suddenly lights up seemingly of its own accord – only to find it is being controlled by another person or device sitting 2-3 tables away. Given my lack of practical experience in this area, I spent most of my time observing and soaking up knowledge, although – and thanks to Soumya Kanti Datta from Eurecom – I did manage to write my first ever routine to get JAWS to announce the status of a car’s rear door (open or closed). Baby steps, maybe, but everyone has to start somewhere! So, apart from suddenly realizing that my development skills are very rusty these days, what did I learn – and particularly in terms of accessibility? WoT User Interface? My main takeaway from the PlugFest was one of change. I left feeling I needed to reevaluate my understandings of the whole concept of the UI, accessibility, and accessibility standards. Although obviously early demonstrative hacks and mashups rather than “complete” products, very few of the proofs-of-concept I encountered appeared to adopt or even require any form of the traditional laptop/desktop/mobile device as the basis of the user interface (UI). Instead, one could almost imagine that any future UI could take on a totally different, but simplified, form – for example, voice as the primary form of input/output, physical buttons and switches, sensors, lights and so on. No browser, no keyboard, no tablet, no phone. That said, this concept wasn’t particularly new for me personally – and, indeed, we’re already starting to see products of this type enter the marketplace. While undertaking my PhD in the mid-2000s, I regularly encountered the argument that we were moving away from the desktop-based, direct manipulation, paradigm of human-computer interaction, and towards an environment where new interaction strategies were required as hand-held, wearable, and other mobile devices are introduced. Indeed, since the advent of the iPhone, Android and other small-screen technologies in the following years, many of the original proposals have come to pass, and we have since devised many new ways of interacting with technology that we simply did not have (commercially, at least) to the same extent ten years ago (for example, touch, swipe, pinch-to-zoom and so on). Perhaps what I encountered is simply the next natural step towards the invisible computer that Don Norman proposed twenty years ago. WoT Assistive Technologies? Much of what I think about on a day-to-day basis with regards to accessibility relates to web accessibility. I, and my colleagues, predominately work with websites, web applications, and native applications that are often indistinguishable from web applications (and vice versa). Consequently, those of us who work in this sphere often think of accessibility in terms of concepts such as browser support, the accessibility API, and web-specific issues such as page structure, keyboard operability and so on. But what if the “thing” has none of those? Why, for example, would a lamp have a browser? Why would a car door have a keyboard? How would one connect a screen reader to a secure entry system in an apartment block? WoT Accessibility (guidelines)? Of course, browsers, phones, tablets and so on are not going away any time soon – and indeed many WoT-networked things may eventually be controllable using an app (native or web-based) or through multiple apps on one’s phone, so we can’t let go of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines that easily either. Yet, as new WoT-based devices are introduced to the market that do not rely on traditional paradigms, we may have to broaden our horizons to consider the accessibility challenges “things” pose that may not necessarily be covered by current accessibility standards, or available to current assistive technologies. For example, my colleague Léonie Watson highlights that, while voice input technology has improved over the years, it can be a somewhat laborious process trying to get the device to understand phrases, and can also be difficult (if not impossible) for users to understand the output. Léonie therefore proposes five tips for building accessible conversational interfaces, such as keeping the language simple, avoiding idioms and colloquialisms, and providing a comparable experience for those who may not be able hear or to communicate with the device (such as providing a text transcript on screen). How can we formally evaluate such technologies, in the same way we evaluate web content against established accessibility guidelines? WoT Future? As I’ve mentioned in previous posts on this subject, the WoT interest and working groups are primarily interested in machine-to-machine interaction. Yet, even at this level, we can start thinking about accessibility implications. My plan over the next few months is to start thinking about accessibility use cases, and the extent to which they relate to ongoing work within the WoT interest and working groups. I would be interested to hear from anyone who has any thoughts – feel free to leave a comment below!  Contrast Analyser, Version 2.1  Posted on Monday, 15 September 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: CCA   The  Colour Contrast Analyser has been updated to reflect changes in WCAG 2.0 Some important clarifications are now included: Note:  Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are incidental text in an image, or that are not visible to anyone, have no minimum contrast requirement. Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

Elaborating on Online Accessibility All school programs and activities — whether in a ‘brick and mortar,’ online, or other ‘virtual’ context — must be operated in a matter that complies with federal disability discrimination laws, This activity is related to specific instructions to college and university presidents that their online content and courses be rendered accessible for students with disabilities.  The notification was in the form of an addendum to an earlier letter encouraging schools to provide assistive technology devices for classroom students and extended that original letter to include online courses. The addendum made it clear that online courses and their content also must be accessible to disabled students — even if none are currently enrolled. Because of the Section 504 requirement of the US Rehabilitation Act of 1973, educational institutions that receive federal monies must provide equal access to courses and materials for students with disabilities.  We are now seeing instances of the Department of Justice as well as special interest groups filing legal briefs and lawsuits to “encourage” compliance. Where does this put you? Without a plan to inventory and audit your online materials and courses, you do not know the scope of the issue that might be in front of you.  Call us today… there is no obligation.  Find out how The Paciello Group can help your institution, as we continue to help many others, identify your options, advise you on solutions and work with you and your authors, developers and instructors, on providing a level playing field for all your students.

It follows on from the first post Be Consistent. In this article we’ll be looking at the principle of providing a comparable experience: “Ensure your interface provides a comparable experience for all so people can accomplish tasks in a way that suits their needs without undermining the quality of the content.” There are two crucial words in the description above: comparable and quality. Comparable Comparable: of equivalent quality; worthy of comparison. We normally talk about equivalent experience when it comes to accessibility: ensuring diverse users have an equivalent or equal user experience to all other users.  This is the goal but in reality is this 100% possible 100% of the time? Let’s look at a couple of scenarios. If I am blind I can access a movie using Audio Description (AD). Everything that is visually editorially significant is described in a separate audio track so I can fully understand the plot of the movie. But can this replace seeing the expression on an actors face in a comedy or a thriller? Is it genuinely an equivalent experience? If I am deaf and cannot hear the soundtrack to a movie I can read the Closed Captions (CC). All speech is transcribed as well as editorially significant sounds and lyrics for music. So far so accessible but is my experience equivalent to someone who can hear the soundtrack? Music can change the atmosphere of a scene in a film drastically. Conveying that visually, via text or signing, is problematic. The film Dunkirk is a great example of how music changes the atmosphere and pace of a movie as it uses a technique called Shepherd Tones in its soundtrack. Wikipedia describes a Shepard Tone as follows: A sound consisting of a superposition of sine waves separated by octaves. When played with the bass pitch of the tone moving upward or downward, it is referred to as the Shepard scale. This creates the auditory illusion of a tone that continually ascends or descends in pitch, yet which ultimately seems to get no higher or lower. As the video below explains the sound illusion makes Dunkirk incredibly intense; so intense that you’re on the edge of your seat in a constant state of apprehension that something bad is going to happen. I found it almost unbearable and the film profoundly difficult to watch. I came away from the cinema thinking ‘How on earth could you provoke that level of intensity to someone who is deaf using Closed Captions’?  Source: The sound illusion that makes Dunkirk so intense via Vox Images are another crucial area of experience for all users including blind users. Typically we categorise and write alt text for images as follows:  Decorative – an image that doesn’t convey information or is described elsewhere on the page and therefore can be hidden from the screen reader user Editorial – an image conveys information that is not conveyed elsewhere on the page and therefore must be described to the screen reader user Functional – an image that performs an action, such as opens a new page or triggers a change on the page, whose purpose must be described to the screen reader user  As Léonie Watson says in her blog post text descriptions and emotion rich images decorative images come in different forms. Horizontal rules, bullets or boarders presented as images have no need for a text alternative but what about ‘vibrant, emotion rich images that provide a website with a sense of atmosphere’? This is the look and feel, branding, and personality of a website. Léonie argues that many blind people, especially those who’ve had sight, appreciate a little personality coming through via the alt text as it helps build a more comparable user experience. On the Inclusive Design Principles website, we have an image of three hot air balloons in the sky. It isn’t a logo or a link and could be categorised as decorative but we put it there visually for a reason – to provoke a response in the user. If it’s there visually why not convey this to a screen reader user? This is why it has the alt text ‘Three hot air balloons hang together in a calm, sunny sky’, to recreate the atmosphere we were aiming for visually. As Léonie says: I used to have sight so I appreciate descriptive alt text on decorative images. It’s is important to respect difference, however. No single person’s experience of disability is the same as another. People who’ve never had sight may find it hard to connect with text alternatives that use highly visual language as Victor Tsaran found out when he visited my home city of Brighton. When he visited Brighton Pavillion he picked up an audio guide – the alternative format for someone who is blind. But he found it unhelpful as it used visual language to describe the rooms that meant nothing to him. He wanted an alternative format that described how people lived in the Pavillion, provided stories and anecdotes. Something that he could relate to. When we were writing the Inclusive Design Principles and the principle of comparable experience we felt that while it was possible to achieve equivalence much of the time it is not possible all of the time. Words, either written or heard, will not always adequately describe what is visible or audible to blind or deaf users. This is why the second word, quality, is crucial. Quality Quality: The standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the degree of excellence of something. Just because we can’t always provide an equivalent experience it doesn’t mean we don’t strive for quality, or ‘excellence’. Again this is where we evolve from accessibility to inclusion. Providing a comparable experience is rooted in providing a quality experience. Quality can be measured in terms of the value of features to the end user, editorial, and efficiency of the interface. By considering the value (another Inclusive Design Principle) of features and how they improve the experience for diverse users you increase the quality of user experience. Take, for example, inputting passwords. In his blog post what I have learnt about motor impairment James Williamson discusses the challenges he has inputting passwords. James has Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), the illness that was the focus of the awareness raising Ice Bucket Challenge in 2014. He uses a combination of voice and a single finger to input text. No matter how accessible the password input field is the experience of inputting complex passwords that require a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters can be difficult and frustrating.  As James says when you can’t see and double check everything before hitting submit it can lead to a ‘high degree of failure’. Adding a ‘Show’ password button to reveal the password allows James to accomplish the task in a way that both suits his needs and ensures efficiency.   Quality is also a differentiator between making something compliant and making it inclusive and a pleasure to use. Let’s go back to Closed Captions. To be compliant with  WCAG Level A and AA, Closed Captions must meet the following: 1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded): Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such. (Level A) This is not sufficient however for ensuring that CC are usable. In fact, it is entirely possible that an older user with deteriorating hearing and eyesight may not be able to read the CC. Many users may not be able to understand who is speaking without colour coding the captions of speakers. Font size, styles, positioning, editorial, colour coding can all make or break the experience. To understand more about creating a comparable experience for CC, or subtitles as they are known in the UK, see the excellent BBC Subtitle Guidelines.  Audio description can also vary in quality. To be compliant with  WCAG Level A and AA, Audio Description must meet the following: 1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded): Audio description is provided for all prerecorded video content in synchronized media. (Level AA) Like with CC meeting this WCAG requirement does not mean we have a comparable experience, however. Quality and comparable experience come in many forms such as good editorial, accurately describing what is relevant, or using a voice that is appropriate to the nature of the movie or programme. Taking it a step further quality a better experience can also come from providing Integrated Described Video (IDV) rather than Audio Description. Instead of being a separate audio track describing editorially significant visuals (AD), IDV naturally describes everything in the main audio track. This first video is an example of Audio Description:  Source: Described video (DV) Example: “Show Me Your Art” via Accessible Media Inc This is the same video but the voiceover is Integrated Described Video:  Source: Integrated Described video (IDV) Example: “Show Me Your Art” via Accessible Media Inc This is a fantastic way to produce educational and instructional video. Not only does it benefit users who are reliant on AD but also sighted users as it conveys the same information visually and verbally making it easier to follow and learn. I want to shout the next two sentences across the rooftops because I think this is so important and we have a huge opportunity to be both innovative and inclusive here: I would love to see the likes of BBC, Netflix, Amazon and more commission new content with a goal of having editorially visible content integrated into the natural speech of the soundtrack. We do this for plays on the radio after all. This would also benefit deaf users as the text is made available through closed captions. Comparable experience in practice As with all the Inclusive Design Principles, providing a comparable experience will be more successful if it is designed from the outset. Project Owners, visual designers, interaction designers, user experience people, content editorial, and even marketing should all be thinking about how diverse users will experience your product early on in the design phase. That way you can commission images that lend themselves to good alt text or commission multimedia that uses IDV rather than having to shoehorn AD into a separate soundtrack. Finally, the following video is probably the most impressive example of comparable experience: How sign language innovators are bringing music to the deaf. Sign Language Interpreter, Amber Galloway Gallego, describes how she turns a hearing centric music world into a visual one. Rather than just focusing on the lyrics and therefore making it accessible, she also focuses on the sounds – base, rhythm, rhyme, rap, holding a note – and how she interprets that into a comparable visual experience. This is a great example of how you can’t have an equivalent experience listening to music if you are deaf but the experience can be comparable given the exceptional quality of sign language interpretation.  The full list of principles and related blog posts are:  Provide a comparable experience Consider situation Be consistent Give control Offer choice Prioritise content Add value  A full explanation of each principle can be found on the Inclusive Design Principles site.  An Accessible Design Maturity Continuum  Posted on Thursday, 26 June 2014 by David Sloan  Category: StrategyCategory: UX   We spend an increasing amount of time helping organizations develop a culture and practice of accessible user experience (AUX). We believe that the chances of creating more inclusive, more effective, more enjoyable digital resources and experiences are increased if accessibility and diversity are integrated into the design approach right from the start. However, this typically requires a significant change in thinking and in practice within the organization. In order to help make this change, it can be useful to identify an organization’s level of what we call accessible design maturity.  Evaluating readiness for positive change When evaluating how best to change an accessible UX strategy for the better, we start by understanding how accessibility is currently considered in strategy and activity, and then identifying how the situation can be improved. One way to do this is to refer to WebAIM’s Hierarchy for Motivating Accessibility Change, which defines a series of stages to help accessibility advocates encourage organizations to adopt accessibility. Another useful approach is to look at an organisation’s current research and design practice, to assess readiness for integrating accessibility into a mature, user-centered design approach. A few years ago, Jess McMullin produced a very helpful model—A Rough Design Maturity Continuum. This model identified five stages of organizational design maturity, ranging from having no conscious design strategy to using design to identify and redefine challenges. A proposed “Accessible Design Maturity Continuum” Using a “design thinking” approach to accessibility in practice, we’ve adapted Jess McMullin’s model to help us think about an organization’s accessible design maturity. Table 1 shows a comparison between the two design continuums.  Table 1: Translating a Rough Design Maturity Continuum into a Rough Accessible Design Maturity Continuum   Design as… McMullin’s Rough Design Maturity Continuum TPG’s Rough Accessible Design Maturity Continuum   1. NO CONSCIOUS DESIGN Design value isn’t recognised. This attitude fosters design by default—however things come out is fine, because there are more important things to deal with. Accessibility isn’t recognized in the design process. Any accessibility happens by chance.   2. STYLE Design is the gateway to be hip and cool. Design is stylish, but too often is perceived and practiced as a cosmetic after thought. Efforts are limited to addition of a few cosmetic accessibility features, with little positive impact on users.   3. FUNCTION AND FORM Design makes things work better. This is the classic practice of design—but it’s still commonly limited to incremental improvements through iteration over existing solutions. Focus is on following accessibility guidelines in order to achieve technical compliance. Improvements are made, but users are not directly part of the accessible design process.   4. PROBLEM SOLVING Design finds new opportunities by solving existing problems. Design process generates alternatives within a problem space. Design also narrows down those options to a specific solution. A more strategic process of researching and designing solutions to support accessible task completion, but still within a pre-defined design concept.   5. FRAMING Design redefines the challenges facing the organisation. Framing sets the agenda, outlines the boundaries and axes of interest. And moves design from executing strategy to shaping strategy. Disruptive innovation lives here. Accessibility and diversity are integrated into the design process, driving creative thought and sparking innovation.    In more detail, the five stages in our accessible design maturity continuum are: 1. No Conscious Design At this most basic stage, organizations have no conscious focus on accessibility, and the needs of people with disabilities are not explicitly considered or recognized in the design process. Any accessibility features that exist happen by chance, and no deliberate efforts are made to enhance accessibility. As a result, the level of accessibility of the output of the design process is likely to be very low. 2. Style Organizations recognize the concept of accessibility but have little in-depth understanding of the objectives and don’t see it as a priority. Attention is not paid to fundamentals of accessible design, like sound structural markup, full keyboard accessibility or appropriate alternative text for images; certain potentially beneficial accessibility features such as keyboard focus indication may be actively resisted for fear of upsetting visual aesthetics. Instead, efforts tend to focus on the addition of a few cosmetic, very visible accessibility features, such as boiler-plate, generic accessibility statements, complex accesskey mappings or adding title attributes to every link—features that might give an impression of delivering accessibility but in reality are of comparatively limited practical help to people with disabilities. 3. Function and Form Recognition of accessibility becomes more mature, but efforts are focused on following accessibility guidelines, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), in order to achieve technical compliance. Activities tend to be driven by the desire to ensure that conformance is achieved, rather than supporting successful task completion. Whilst technical accessibility levels are raised, involvement of people with disabilities in research and design work to understand the problem space and validate appropriate solutions is still minimal. As a result, in some cases, well-meaning accessibility efforts adversely affect user experience for people with disabilities, for example through the presence of over-elaborate alternative text for every image, or the inclusion of static content in a page’s keyboard focus order. 4. Problem Solving At this point, consideration of people with diverse accessibility needs plays a much stronger role in accessible design activity, and user experience design becomes more prominent. While accessibility guidelines still play an important role in the design process, focus moves from conformance testing to supporting successful task completion by people with disabilities, and identifying, designing and evaluating ways in which people who use assistive technology can effectively navigate, receive information and enter data. However, this more strategic approach to accessible design still exists within an established design approach, and there may be significant technical or design constraints that limit the scope to create optimally accessible user experiences. 5. Framing At the highest level of maturity, designing to accommodate user diversity is recognized and embraced as an integral part of the design process. People with disabilities are involved in UX research and design activities right from the start, and a more sensitive awareness of needs and preferences encourages creative approaches to identifying real world challenges and designing new and effective ways of tackling them. The result is digital products and services that can be used in diverse, and possibly unexpected situations, and in diverse and unexpected ways. Using the continuum to measure and drive progress First introduced at our UX Scotland 2014 workshop, we hope this accessibility maturity continuum can aid organizations in assessing their current approach to accessible UX design, how far they need to move in order to effectively embrace accessible UX, and what activities are needed in order to help them get there. We think that adopting a design thinking approach to accessible UX—combining a solid understanding of how people with disabilities currently use digital resources with a creative approach to identifying solutions—can help organizations move more rapidly and successfully along the continuum.    New Workshop on People First Design  Posted on Monday, 16 January 2017 by Sarah Horton  Category: ConferencesCategory: StrategyCategory: TrainingCategory: UX   In digital product design there is a collective movement towards human-centered design—a professional recognition of the damage we can (and do) cause with technology that doesn’t put people’s needs first. As accessibility consultants we regularly encounter ways that technology prevents people with disabilities from participating successfully, in employment, education, and in everyday life. Our accessibility work helps us appreciate the power product designers have over quality of life, and provides insights into how to use that power for good. We are delivering a new workshop on what we call “People First Design,” exploring practical ways to improve digital product and services by focusing UX efforts on people with disabilities. Our first session is at the IA Summit in Vancouver on March 22nd, which is full-day workshop. We’ll also be offering a half-day workshop at UX Lisbon on May 24th. People First Design is a new approach to a human-centered design process, strongly influenced by our experience of working with people with disabilities. The workshop is a chance for us to share what what we’ve learned from our user research involving people with disabilities, and the impact it has had on our clients’ approach to inclusive design. And it’s a chance for you to learn and apply an approach to research and design that respects human diversity, to produce more successful products. People First Design sees diversity as an opportunity rather than a complication. Prioritizing the needs of people can be difficult, given other pressures and objectives. Involving people with disabilities in user research might seem challenging. This workshop helps people working in digital product and service design build strategies and tactics for focusing attention on people with disabilities. Focusing on disability helps concentrate efforts on identifying extreme situations and needs in parallel with routine, common scenarios. The result is a greater understanding of how to design to accommodate diverse scenarios. We’d love to have you join us!

Conforming to this criteria provides accommodation for people to modify their text styles according to their needs. The success criterion defines a set of text styles that must be supported. Thinking that this should be pretty simple to test using a bookmarklet I went searching for one that someone may have prepared previously. Not finding any, I whipped one up.  What the success criterion requires; In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:  Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size; Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size; Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size; Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.  source: 1.4.12 Text Spacing Using a bookmarklet that applies these styles to a page when activated, the styled content can be visually scanned to identify any issues such as clipping or overlaying of content. The Text Spacing bookmarklet On Tuesday night, way past my bedtime, the Text Spacing bookmarklet was born: On Codepen: text spacing bookmarklet See the Pen text spacing bookmarklet by steve faulkner (@stevef) on CodePen.  Permalink to the Text Spacing Bookmarklet Addendum I found out later that there was another bookmarklet to test this criteria:  If that doesn\\'t have any dependencies and works across a reasonable browser spread, it\\'s better than the quick one I did previously (https://t.co/pzzPHxTos3). Will that URL be stable? — Alastair Campbell (@alastc) May 22, 2018   The Paciello Group and WebAIM Announce Web Site Certification Services for Accessibility  Posted on Thursday, 19 March 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: News   Press Release TPG & WebAIM Press release (microsoft Word document, 33 KB) March 18, 2009 – Nashua, NH. The Paciello Group (TPG) and WebAIM are pleased to announce today a partnership that delivers a new, independent program for web site certification for accessibility. In today’s diverse environment, the Internet is becoming the pre-eminent location for people with disabilities to find information and to transact business. It is vitally important for web site creators and operators to take all appropriate steps to ensure their web properties are universally accessible. However, many people with disabilities are finding an unacceptable level of accessibility for many popular web sites, creating a frustrating experience. Now, with the partnership between TPG and WebAIM, web site owners can retain The Paciello Group to perform full accessibility testing and professional services while additionally receiving the WebAIM Accessible Site Certification. This certificate can be posted on their web site attesting to an independent guarantee. While some web site certifications exist today, it is believed this is the first independent certification performed by a party other than the company delivering testing services. TPG and WebAIM are forming this partnership to ensure the highest level of accessibility services and to also insure full independence between the testing and certification agencies. Mike Paciello, founder and president of The Paciello Group addresses the value of independent certification: “There are a number of companies delivering quality professional services to help vendors make their sites more accessible, but we wanted to offer our clients the assurance that the work we are performing is of the highest quality and attested to by a completely independent authority. WebAIM’s position in the accessibility market as a recognized leader in practice and passion for accessibility makes them the logical choice to deliver this independent certification. We are thrilled to partner with them.” The Paciello Group is passionately dedicated to helping government agencies, technology vendors, e-commerce corporations, and educational institutions make their technology equally accessible to all people, including those with disabilities. The company, based in Nashua, NH, offers professional consulting, technology solutions, and monthly monitoring services to ensure that clients reach all audiences effectively and efficiently while meeting governmental and international standards. WebAIM, Web Accessibility in Mind, provides comprehensive web accessibility solutions. Ten years of experience makes WebAIM one of the leading providers of web accessibility expertise internationally.

GAAD 2017: I wish I’d known…  Posted on Thursday, 18 May 2017 by Ian Pouncey  Category: Conferences   GAAD: I wish I’d known…  To celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day, and inspired by Billy Gregory’s talk “Things I Wish I Knew When I Started in Digital Accessibility”, we’ve asked our accessibility engineers for things they wish they’d known when they started out in accessibility.  Léonie Watson: I wish I’d had somewhere like the A11y Slackers channel when I was starting out. It’s a free and open place to ask accessibility related questions, and get answers from a lot of smart people.   Mark Novak: It wasn’t “things I wish I’d known” but “people I’d wish I’d known”, specifically people like those I met at my very first disability related conference back in 1988 who were using assistive technology (lots of augmentative communication devices) that inspired me to follow the path i’ve been on now for almost 30 years, and to also not listen to others who often said ‘that can’t be done’.   Jon Metz: I wish I had known that using as much of the built-in settings in applications like Word and InDesign would have made fixing a PDF 10 times easier. If those programs are exporting to PDF, obviously it’s using whatever setting the software maker uses, but it took me a while to figure that part out.   Heydon Pickering: One thing I wish I’d gotten my head around sooner was how important connecting up the dots in interfaces is for accessibility. It’s not just about making discrete elements have accessible labels and legible fonts; it’s also about the journeys users take through pages, by keyboard, screen reader, touch exploration, or visual affordance. Structural order and relationships are so important.   David Swallow: I wish I had started out thinking about web accessibility in terms of actually supporting people to use the web, rather than merely ensuring conformance to a set of guidelines. Once you go beyond the guidelines, and focus on providing a positive user experience for people of all abilities and disabilities, web accessibility stops being an onerous, rule-bound task and becomes an interesting and creative challenge.   Sarah Horton: I wish I had known about change management as a tool for advancing accessibility in a profound, systemic way. I didn’t realize how much redirection is needed for accessibility to become a standard in the technology field, and a requirement for being a technology professional. If I had know, I would have learned more about human factors and change and had more change management tools in my toolkit, such as the guiding principles and practices of liminal thinking, methods of design thinking, and the gentle art of humble inquiry, to help people, teams, and organizations transition to prioritizing accessibility in their technology projects.   Graeme Coleman: I wish I had appreciated that the entry point for web accessibility isn’t necessarily about becoming an expert screen reader user, or knowing the WAI-ARIA specification inside out, but (for me) simply a willingness to produce and promote clean, standardised HTML, combined with a strong and unwavering empathy for people who may face barriers to your product when this is not the case. As with all web development, learning about accessibility is achieved through learning by doing, for example by (re)building or following examples such as those created by Heydon Pickering and Hans Hillen. You can use those examples to understand how complex widgets can be coded accessibility, and to get familiar with assistive technologies, but bear in mind it is absolutely fine to take baby steps – once you gain this grounding, you can build your knowledge further through reading the WAI-ARIA specification in more detail, and becoming a more experienced and confident accessibility practitioner.   David Sloan: When I was starting out, I wish I’d known that while following accessibility standards and guidelines is vital, it’s not the only thing you need to do to create great user experiences for people with disabilities. Involving people with disabilities early and throughout the design process is a valuable way to help you better understand a problem and design better solutions to the problem. One book I wish I’d had from the beginning is Graham Pullin’s “Design meets Disability”, which beautifully demonstrates how thinking more about disability can influence and inspire great design. I’d recommend it as essential reading for anyone setting out to work in accessibility and inclusive design.   Hans Hillen: I wish I’d spent more time using AT products in my daily interactions, in order to get a better understanding of the issues faced each day by the people whose user experience we try to improve.   Adrian Roselli: When I was first starting out playing in accessibility in the late 90s / early oughts, I wish I had known how easy it is to access local organizations that offer services for constituents with disabilities. Getting real users with real experience with assistive technology to walk you through their tools and your sites was an experience I wish not only I had sooner, but I wish every developer and instructor had today.   Matthew Tylee Atkinson: I wish I knew just how much of a community there was around accessibility and how willing people are to share expertise, particularly if it results in a patch getting submitted to their code – picking up accessibility bugs on established projects and learning through peer review from more experienced people is a great way to pick stuff up.   Jonny James: I think the most important piece of advice I could share with anyone starting out (and I’m still just starting out myself), is to become accustomed with the tools of web accessibility. It could be a screen reader that may already be built into your computer or device. It could be The Paciello Group’s Colour Contrast Analyser, which is free and available for download. It could be ZoomText. There are so many options out there, and I wouldn’t suggest one over the other. You will find out which one works best for you, and even that will change over time. It is the tools that are the conduit to understanding how others navigate the web and ultimately the world around us. Through that understanding, you develop empathy for others, and as your scope of web accessibility broadens, so will your insight and passion. There is nothing sexier in this world than understanding and compassion for your fellow human beings.   Michiel Bijl: I wish I knew about ARIA and its Authoring Practices when I started out in accessibility. Both documents have helped me tremendously to get a deeper understanding of how everything works behind the scenes and what it means for a website to be accessible. Perhaps more importantly, they have helped me to write better, more stable, and all-around more inclusive websites and web apps.   Justin Stockton: The thing that I wish I had when I got started in accessibility is a community. When I first got started in accessibility in 2001, all I had was Section 508, Bobby reports and what I could find on Yahoo! and Altavista to guide me. It was bleak times and we used a lot of trial and error to make things accessible with the handful of users we had access too.  Favourite ID24 talks  For the last three years the Inclusive Design 24 event, 24 completely free one-hour webinars on all things accessibility, has been on GAAD. This year we’ll be holding it on 9 June 2017 instead, but for old times’ sake here are some of our favourite talks.  Léonie Watson: Accessible Web Components using Polymer by Alice Boxhall, 2014 This was one of the first talks I heard about Web Components and accessibility. It describes the technologies that underpin Web Components, and how you can use the Polymer library to make accessible components. Web Components (and Custom Elements in particular) have changed since 2014, but this remains an area of exciting possibilities – both for development and for accessibility.   Henny Swan: Accessibility by Design by Laura Kalbag, 2015. Inclusion starts with design. I love how Laura gives a designer perspective not on what is just ‘pretty’, but what is pretty effective, in other words inclusive.   Ian Pouncey: Uncharted 4: A New Adventure in Video Game Accessibility by Sony Interactive Entertainment, 2016 The first of two talks on game accessibility in 2016, this was a great introduction to the accessibility features in games like Uncharted 4, and the decision making process for including control and content alternatives.   Steve Faulkner: Changing Tides: 2015’s Games Industry Accessibility Advancements by Ian Hamilton, 2016 Ian Hamilton is a great source of game accessibility knowledge, something I know pitifully little about, It’s great to have folks like him pushing a11y in games forward.   disclosure-button custom control  Posted on Friday, 2 May 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Cedric Trevisan and I have been cooking up a simple custom element, web component (using polymer) that provides a flexible disclosure control with accessibility baked in. It’s still in progress (Cedric will follow up with a detailed post on how he got it to work!) but here’s a sneak peak:  disclosure-button – specification doc. disclosure-button – working demo 1 and working demo 2 Note: demos use older syntax than what is described in the specification doc. disclosure-button repo on github  Further Reading Usability and accessibility opportunities in a web component world    Color Contrast Analyzer 2.2 – updated contrast ratio  Posted on Monday, 15 December 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: CCA   The English version of the Color Contrast Analyzer and the German, French, Czech, and Italian versions for Windows have been updated, MACÂ version all languages updated, to reflect the change in the ratio at which color combinations are deemed to meet the contrast ratio criteria in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0: Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background. WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)- WCAG 2 The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:  Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1; Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement. Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement. (Level AA)  Guideline 1.4.6: Contrast (Enhanced) – WCAG 2 The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except for the following: (Level AAA)  Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1; Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.

Participating in the web community has long been important to TPG, and 2017 gave us many opportunities to carry on doing so.  Talks We gave more than 20 talks at conferences around the world, and shared our slides and videos after the fact. We talked about accessibility as a focus for People First design, making SVG accessible, doing inclusive usability testing, what’s coming after WCAG 2.1, writing with plain language, the history of synthetic speech, accessible code for web designers, and many other topics. Inclusive Design 24 (#ID24) We hosted two editions of Inclusive Design 24 (#ID24). #ID24 is a free online community conference consisting of 24 talks on various aspects of inclusive design. The June edition of #ID24 included talks on accessible comics, inclusive Media Queries, accessible smart cities, designing for older users, rethinking color and contrast, scaling accessibility, and inclusive UX research. The November edition of #ID24 included talks on designing conversations, VR accessibility, the Internet of Things, accessibility for Deaf and hard of hearing people, HTML email accessibility, accessible React, and 100 days of accessibility. Thank you to all our friends from across the industry who contributed so many talks on such a diverse range of inclusive design topics! We opened the #ID24 YouTube channel, where you’ll find all the talks from the November edition. Talks from earlier editions remain on the Paciello Group YouTube channel. People tuned in to watch #ID24 online from more than 70 different countries, and for the first time there were “host your own” #ID24 events. Organisations streamed #ID24 live to venues in Germany, Australia, The Netherlands, and the USA. W3C Our participation at W3C continued during 2017. Jeanne Spellman, Sarah Horton, and David Sloan, were a driving force behind the advanced research for Silver (the codename for the successor to WCAG). Patrick Lauke continued as chair of the Pointer Events Working Group (WG), and editor of the Pointer Events 2.0 specification. He also participated in the Accessibility Guidelines (AG) WG, championing new WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria for touch screen devices. Ian Pouncey became co-facilitator of the CSS Accessibility Task Force (TF), a collaboration between the CSS WG, ARIA WG, and the Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) WG. He also became editor of the SVG Accessibility API Mappings (AAM) specification. Steve Faulkner remained as editor of the HTML specification, until HTML5.2 was released on 14 December. After 10 years as HTML editor, he stepped down to focus his efforts on editing the ARIA in HTML and HTML AAM specifications. Graeme Coleman and Adrian Roselli kept a watching brief on the Web Of Things (WoT) WG, and Hans Hillen stepped up to join the ARIA Authoring Practices TF. Léonie Watson carried on as co-chair of the Web Platform WG, and as a member of the W3C Advisory Board. Teach Access We continued to contribute to the Teach Access initiative. Teach Access is a collaboration between organisations from the digital sector, and colleges and universities. It’s mission is to make accessibility and inclusive design a core part of the curriculum for students studying all aspects of the digital world. David Sloan and Sarah Horton were active in the Evidence Packets TF, the Accreditation TF, and the Student Engagement TF. Sarah was also asked to chair the Evidence Packets TF. Inclusive Design Principles We released the Inclusive Design Principles. The Inclusive Design Principles are about putting people first, designing for temporary, permenant, situational, or changing disabilities – all of us really. Our friends at Barclays designed a set of Inclusive Design posters. Thanks to other members of the web community, the principles are currently available in French, Spanish, and Japanese. Jaws issue tracker With help from our colleagues at Freedom Scientific, we started a project to document Jaws support for web technologies (HTML, ARIA, CSS, and SVG). At the same time we opened a public issue tracker where people can file issues with Jaws and any of the four web technologies. Tools We launched Cupper, the inclusive documentation builder created by Heydon Pickering. Mathew Atkinson released an updated version of the Landmarks extension, bringing landmark navigation to Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, for sighted keyboard users. Updates to our free Colour Contrast Analyser and aViewer tools were released in 2017, helping people test accessibility. Books and articles Henny Swan wrote a cover story for Netmag, about using the Inclusive Design Principles, and Adrian Roselli contributed another article on Selfish Accessibility (not available online unfortunately). Sarah Horton and David Sloan also collaborated with Monica Reha to write about a research study with Wells Fargo, for the Journal of Digital and Social Marketing. Heydon Pickering published a book on Inclusive Design Patterns, Léonie Watson was technical editor for Laura Kalbag’s book Accessibility For Everyone, and David Sloan co-authored a chapter for the book Disability, Human Rights, and Information Technology, with Mary Ziegler of MIT. Guides We published a free guide to Mobile Accessibility Testing for Android and iOS. The guide provides an overview of accessibility settings, how to use them, and information on common testing tools for touch screen devices. Meetups and events Members of the TPG team continued to put their own time and energies into hosting accessibility meetups and events in 2017. Dennis Deacon with the Chicago Digital Accessibility and Inclusive Design meetup, Adrian Roselli with the Buffalo Accessibility meetup, and Billy Gregory with the A11yTo (Accessibility Toronto) meetup. Billy and the rest of the A11yTo team also hosted the first A11yTo Conference – a two day event that TPG was proud to sponsor. Blog posts We published more than 60 posts on this blog over the past 12 months. Posts range across many different subjects, including how invert brightness helps improve accessibility, considerations for accessible kiosks, accessibility in the Agile lifecycle, ARIA alert support, PDF inaccessibility, the Section 508 refresh, and of course the story in which our intrepid hero trips and falls. Awards Each year the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) recognises someone for their contribution to our industry. This year the lifetime achievement award was given to David Sloan. In the words of RNIB’s chair Kevin Carey: I wish to make awards recognising that “Lifetime” is somewhat inappropriate for people who are by no means at the end of their careers but I hope you will accept my nomination in the spirit in which it is intended, as recognition of outstanding achievement in the sector. What a note to end the year on!  JavaScript touch/pointer events research notes: screenreaders, faked mouse events, touchscreens  Posted on Thursday, 10 April 2014 by Patrick H. Lauke  Category: Strategy   Over the last two years I’ve been dabbling with various aspects related to the handling of touch events and pointer events – specifically trying to determine which events are being dispatched by browsers as a result of touchscreen interactions, and what the repercussions of this are considering the increasing number of multi-input devices (such as laptops that feature both traditional keyboard/mouse/trackpad as well as a touchscreen, or nominally touch-only devices such as smartphones and tablets, but paired with a bluetooth mouse/keyboard).  One of the early outcomes of this research was an article on the Mozilla Hacks blog on the futility of trying to detect touchscreen users. Since joining The Paciello Group about a year ago, I expanded my experimentations to also include accessibility-specific scenarios – in particular, the intersection between touch and assistive technology (classic iOS/VoiceOver and Android/TalkBack, but also more recent additions such as JAWS 15 and its new Windows 8 touch support). Tired of just keeping notes and tidbits of information strewn around (for instance, see the various ever-changing iterations of my talk Getting touchy – an introduction to touch and pointer events), I finally compiled a single resource for my various touch/pointer test results (though perhaps the title is now slightly inaccurate, as the results also include traditional “desktop” screenreaders used with the keyboard, mainly as a point of comparison with screenreaders on touch devices). Although I’m still in the process of making sense of these test results as they relate to some of our tried and tested accessibility techniques, it might be interesting to just mention a few notable nuggets of information that emerged:  even in the case of desktop keyboard users, certain combinations of browsers and screenreaders (Chrome with JAWS or NVDA, Firefox with NVDA, and all browsers tested in OS X with VoiceOver) fire “faked” mousedown and mouseup events – in addition to the regular click – when a focusable element is activated. when using VoiceOver on OS X, different events are fired depending on how elements are activated – for instance, activating a button with SPACE or ENTER will simply fire click, whereas CTRL+ALT+SPACE (the key combination prompted by VoiceOver) also fires the aforementioned “faked” mouse events. when using a screenreader on a mobile/tablet device, moving the focus (swiping left/right and using “touch explore”) will fire a JavaScript focus event – except in Firefox/Android with TalkBack, where focus is only sent as part of the series of events that follow an activation (double-tap). mobile screenreaders are quite liberal in firing additional blur events when an element is activated – presumably in an attempt to prevent focus-specific CSS styles to “stick” after a user tapped on an in-page link or control; careful if your code assumes blur means the user has moved away from the focusable element, as the AT focus is actually still there. using a desktop screenreader with a touchscreen and touch gestures (swipe left/right and using “touch explore”, similar to mobile/tablet screenreaders), none of the tested combinations of browser/AT fired a focus event when moving the focus outline to an element – focus is only sent as a result of a double-tap activation.  The results contain further interesting, often browser-specific quirks, but these will likely only be of use when debugging a particularly weird bit of behavior in your website/application. In the meantime, I hope this collection of results will be of some use. If there’s a specific combination of operating system/assistive technology/browser that you’d like to see included, get in touch.  Tweaking HTML5 – edition for web authors  Posted on Wednesday, 2 March 2011 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   In mid 2010 Anthony Kolber and Ben Schwarz started a discussion about the usability of W3C specifications, this resulted in Ben and Anthony’s initial restyled version of the W3C HTML5 – Edition for Web Authors.  Tweaks needed Feedback was provided about aspects of the accessibility of the design, suggested changes were not implemented due to constraints on Ben’s time. Not wanting to be a lazy accessibility curmudgeon who complains but doesn’t do anything “all mouth no trousers“, after waiting a respectful 6 months and after discussion with Ben and Mike Smith, I spent some time modifying the original design to improve accessibility, this resulted in the latest incarnation of HTML5 – Edition for Web Authors. It is hoped that Ben or somebody else with more design chops than I will  continue to develop HTML5 – Edition for Web Authors with accessibility in mind, but until someone else steps up to give it some love, I am happy to work on it. Please provide feedback on ways it can be improved! Changes made to the original design  Text and background colours modified to provide sufficient contrast for users with low to moderate vision impairments. added CSS :focus pseudo selectors, so a clear indication of current focus is provided. Left aligned content to provide increased usability for screen magnifier users. (helpful or not?) Underlined links within paragraphs so that color is not the only differentiator between link text embedded in plain text. (helpful or not?) Removed text shadows. Added extra borders to data tables. (helpful or not?) Hid some of the boiler plate text guff. Changed default body text to verdana then changed it back to sans-serif type and then back again to verdana after discussion with John Foliot, while there is no conclusive evidence as to the readability or legibility of serif vs sans-serif fonts, I find serif fonts harder to read in large blocks of text (irony that this blog uses serif fonts is noted). What about you?  Still to do  Make the pop up menus on dfn elements keyboard operable and usable by assistive technology users. Any problem colour combinations missed? Re-organise boilerplate text so it is available, but not in the way. Respond to any feedback provided.   Inclusive Design 24 (#ID24) November 2017  Posted on Monday, 14 August 2017 by Léonie Watson  Category: Conferences    We had so much fun in June we’re doing it again. Inclusive Design 24 (#ID24) is on Thursday 16 November 2017, and the call for presentations is open!  Still in its fourth year, this will be the fifth edition of #ID24. It’s a free 24 hour online conference for the web community, organised by The Paciello Group. As its name suggests, Inclusive Design 24 covers all aspects of design and development. If you have a story to tell, a solution to share, or ideas to discuss that will help people level up their accessibility skills, then we want to hear from you. It’s #ID24 tradition to feature both experienced speakers and new voices, from many different countries and places, all of whom have something practical, inspirational, creative, and useful to say about inclusive design. So whether you’re an accomplished speaker or putting together your first talk, whether you work for a huge company or you work for yourself, whether you’re in Azerbaijan or Zimbabwe, if you’ve got something to say about inclusive design, we want to hear from you! The call for presentations closes on Sunday 17 September. If you have any questions drop id24@paciellogroup.com an email, or head to inclusivedesign24.org for more information.  The Helen Project – More Social Accessibility  Posted on Tuesday, 2 September 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: News   The Helen Project is an initiative by the American Foundation the Blind to provide all internet users, especially people with disabilities, the opportunity to register publically available feedback on the accessibility of sites they use: We offer you a free downloadable, fully accessible, web site rating toolbar application (which we affectionately named “Helen“) that will enable you to have your voice heardas you experience problems and/or success in using any web site. And, most importantly, Helen will enable the collective voice of the user community to be heard by web site providers, To be part of the Helen project you need to register. Users can then participate by installing a free browserÂ toolbar to rate web sites on web accessibility. Currently the toolbar is only compatible with Internet Explorer for Windows versions 5, 6, and 7. Further Reading:  Welcome to The Helen Project! Social Accessibility – Threes a Crowd?   Business as usual  Posted on Wednesday, 3 May 2017 by Léonie Watson  Category: News   We’ve been asked a lot of questions since the announcement that TPG has joined VFO. Our friends and colleagues across the industry want to know what the news means for TPG, and the short answer is that it’s “business as usual”.  We are still TPG, and we’ll continue to operate on the founding principles that Mike Paciello put in place back in 2002. This means we remain impartial advocates for inclusive design. Our methodologies continue to be both technology and assistive technology agnostic, and we put people – not technology – first across all our activities. We continue to participate in the community; tweeting and blogging as individuals, and collectively on this blog and the TPG Twitter account. Our standards work at W3C continues, as does our involvement with projects like Teach-Access and HTML5accessibility.com. We develop tools for the community including the Colour Contrast Analyser (CCA) and aViewer, host events like Inclusive Design 24, and support others like A11y Toronto and role=drinks. When we asked Matt Ater (VFO Vice President) to put it into words, he summed it up clearly: Trust TPG, we’re your trusted accessibility partner – hold us to it. The TPG Team.  Accessibility and the self-organizing team  Posted on Monday, 29 May 2017 by Justin Stockton  Category: Development   In our last article on Accessibility in an Agile Lifecycle, we began talking about the importance of including all members of the software development team in the process of building accessible software. In many Agile methodologies, teams are meant to be self-organizing in order to allow team members to take those tasks that best fit their particular skillset. For example, a front-end developer might take on the HTML, CSS and JavaScript tasks for a story while a Database Administrator might take on the database related tasks. This allows the team to leverage the strengths of individuals to complete more tasks with lower risks during the sprint. The question you’re probably asking yourself then is, if teams are self-organizing, then doesn’t that mean that the person with the accessibility knowledge ends up with all of the accessibility related stories? On some teams, this is likely the case. However, what if we flip this question around to ask a slightly different, but related question? If teams are self-organizing, then doesn’t that mean that the person with the security knowledge ends up with all of the security related stories? That sounds crazy, right? In today’s world of Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) and RansomWare attacks (to name a few), shouldn’t the whole team be aware of how to write and test their code so that they don’t release an insecure product? You probably have a Security Person or Team that’s responsible for validating the product and they probably even have some special tools they use for making sure the product is secure against the latest threats that the development team hasn’t had time to learn about yet. If you’ve been in accessibility for any amount of time, that scenario probably sounds rather familiar. This is why the same idea goes for developing something so that it is accessible as it does for secure. Once the commitment is made by the organization and the development team to build something that is accessible, the team, not individuals, is responsible for seeing that commitment through to its success. So how do we do this? My favorite way is to demystify accessibility by talking to team members in each role on how the various accessibility laws and guidelines will affect their work. By the end of your chat, you want your developers to know that they can still use cutting edge tools like AngularJS and React. Designers and UX professionals will be happy to hear that building something that is accessible doesn’t mean it’s going to be ugly or have a clunky UI. I also make sure to explain accessibility to the Database Administrators, backend developers, the security folks, and whomever else has is part of the development team, so that they begin thinking of how accessibility might affect their role. Once the team has a better understanding of what accessibility is and how it effects their role, it is usually much easier to get them to take on accessibility related tasks. You’ll still need to check their work and perform your usual accessibility testing, but over time you’ll begin noticing fewer and fewer accessibility issues make it to your desk as the team, not just the accessibility professional, becomes responsible for developing an accessible product.  AOL/TopCoder Accessibility Developer Competition  Posted on Wednesday, 20 May 2009 by Steve Faulkner  Category: News   AOL/TopCoder® Accessibility Developer Competition to Culminate at 2009 TopCoder Open.

Posted on Friday, 26 June 2015 by Mike Paciello  Category: Strategy   A few weeks ago, several of us were in Florence, Italy attending the annual W4A conference when we received great news about the University of Colorado-Boulder (CU-B): the US Department of Justice had closed it’s investigation into possible non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). CU-B still has work to accomplish, but we see this as a great step forward toward building inclusive education. Congrats CU-B! I’m on public record saying that I not a fan of fear-based incentives including lawsuits and/or federal inquiries. The Department of Justice (DOJ) continues to issue various inquiries and interventions which, as you might expect, builds awareness of the issues in general, but often serves as a threatening stick, rather than a carrot. Sometimes these situations become rife with contention rather than stimulation for positive change. It seems to me that educational institutions and private industry have the capacity and capability to ensure, for example, that educational systems and IT are designed to serve all people, regardless of ability. However, and in my humble opinion, until we create a truly compelling business value proposition for private industry and higher education, fear-based incentives and enforceable laws will continue to be the primary drivers of accessibility. I’m just sayin’ So, how do we move away from fear-based incentives to inclusive thinking? One suggestion is to consider rebooting our accessibility strategy and focus on an inside-out approach… Accessibility Strategy Refocus I’ve been thinking about something that Sarah Horton, David Sloan and Henny Swan emphasized in their recent W4A award-winning paper, “Complementing Standards by Demonstrating Commitment and Progress“: What if, in addition to evaluating products against standards, we focus energy and resources on activities related to creating a culture, practice, and processes that support accessibility? A coordinated accessibility program, with documentation and continual assessment, provides the means to demonstrate commitment and progress toward achieving accessibility. In this way, accessibility moves from a standards-based remediation activity that is characterized by standards failures and technical remediation to an endeavor that is focused on people and good experience, and targets successful progress forward towards an accessible digital environment. Inherently, I’m a ‘swing first, think second’ person. Then I remind myself of Daniel Kahneman’s encouragement towards ‘System 2’ thinking (Captioned Video) — a little slower, more deliberate in process and logic. Which is why the culture, practice and process accessibility template this paper presents is spot on! This is a principled leadership, inclusion-driven model. It’s top-to-bottom, horizontal and pervasive. It’s an exemplar strategy. It involves hard work, integrity, systemic commitment and direct support from organizational leadership. It’s the kind of thing we are witnessing at CU-B. Within CU-B, Chancellor Philip P. DiStefano, Robert Boswell, Vice-Chancellor for Diversity, Equity, and Community Engagement, Larry Levine, Chief Information Officer, and recently appointed Chief Digital Accessibility Officer Dan Jones, are providing that commitment and leadership, ensuring that the university accessibility efforts are aligned with the core principles of diversity, inclusion and equal access. What’s encouraging is that higher ed institutions and private industry can look to the example of CU-B as the start of a successful vision. CU-B’s commitment from the top demonstrates how accessibility in practice is forward thinking and has the potential of removing the sting of fear-based incentives. What do you think? By the way, if you’re interested in reading a little more about TPG’s User Experience work with CU-B, see David Sloan’s article, “Making Real Progress in Digital Accessibility in Higher Education“.  Notes on notes (of smart people) about web components  Posted on Friday, 12 September 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The Extensible Web Summit happened in Berlin yesterday. This prompted written words from some big thinkers and doers. Jeremy Keith wrote a piece on Web Components followed up by a uncomfortably excited response from Alex Russell. On Piffle and Tosh and feasting upon Fetid code While I am as excited as the next nerd by the potential of web components. Their development and marketing appear to follow the same depressing pattern of ship first, oh yeah we better tack on some ARIA to cover up the cracks. Alex stated yesterday: Jeremy’s argument, if I can paraphrase, is that people will build Web Components and this might be bad [for accessibility]. … Piffle and tosh. I cannot but agree with Alex piffle wise. Jeremy’s argument does not go far enough.  Web components are being built in the same development culture that web stuff is usually built in, and this is bad for accessibility. This is not to say that web components are by definition bad. It is the same story for any implementation of accessibility support on the web, in browsers and in UI libraries: it usually comes after, often way after a product has been shipped and distributed to millions upon millions of people and 100s of thousands of developers have gorged on and regurgitated the code in their own projects. Examples? Some tweets I wrote in June (in usual diplomatic style) upon initial release of Polymer Paper web components which may well be fantastic examples of what can be achieved with this new technology, but were sadly lacking in even the most basic accessibility considerations (this situation has improved but they are still riddled with issues): new polymer demos are cool http://t.co/Zid5ko0ion http://t.co/9B2qUl3Ifx http://t.co/IWIVdyMlNv except for keyboard or assistive tech users — Steve Faulkner (@stevefaulkner) June 25, 2014   … making showcase UI components with minimal UX/AX is just taking the piss — Steve Faulkner (@stevefaulkner) June 25, 2014     @dstorey @patrick_h_lauke @marcysutton not point, much $$$$ +brains invested by @google on @polymer bling “Welcome to the future” dogfood — Steve Faulkner (@stevefaulkner) June 25, 2014   Alex stated yesterday: Luckily we’ve been thinking very hard about this at Google and have invested heavily in Polymer and high-quality Material Design components that are, as I write this, undergoing review and enhancement for accessibility. … The economics of the new situation that Web Components introduce are (intentionally) tilted in a direction that provides ability for cream to rise to the top — and for the community to quickly judge if it smell off and do something about it. As Alex stated “Google … have invested heavily in Polymer” and also invest in accessibility (see references). What I can’t comprehend is why that investment of big smarts and big bucks by Google did not include the integration of accessibility and usability into the core development cycle? Why is it considered the community’s job to polish the turds?

Native UI controls have accessibility built-in as standard, and custom controls can be accessibility-enabled without difficulty.  When it comes to testing, there is no substitute for using your app on an iOS device with VoiceOver turned on. When your app (or prototype) is in a fit state to be deployed on a device, testing it with VoiceOver, or better still asking VoiceOver users to test it, will give you realistic feedback. Accessibility Inspector (available in the iOS Simulator) can then be used to debug any problems you discover. Accessibility Inspector lets you simulate VoiceOver interactions, and examine the accessibility information that’s available for the controls in your app. Accessibility Inspector doesn’t have speech output, so it’s a debugging tool rather than a testing tool. Testing with VoiceOver and debugging with the Accessibility Inspector is a good approach though. Testing with VoiceOver You can turn VoiceOver on/off at any time by triple clicking the home button, but the first time it’s a good idea to go to Settings > General > Accessibility > VoiceOver and tap the switch to turn it on. At the same time check that Speak Hints is enabled (it’s on by default). Hints will help you use VoiceOver, and you’ll also want to test any hints included in your app. When VoiceOver is turned on you’ll need a different set of gestures. The following basic gestures will help you test your app:  Move finger on screen Causes VoiceOver to announce whatever is under your finger. Single tap Causes VoiceOver to announce the selected control. Double tap Activates the selected control. Flick left/right Moves to the previous/next control. Three finger swipe left/right Moves to the previous/next screen.  When you test your app it’s a good idea to simulate the experience of a VoiceOver user as closely as possible. Triple tap to turn the screen curtain on/off. This disables the visual display on the device, letting you explore your app using VoiceOver alone. Debugging with Accessibility Inspector To turn on Accessibility Inspector, run your app in iOS Simulator, go to Home > Settings > General > Accessibility and slide the Accessibility Inspector switch to on. This opens the Accessibility Inspector panel. Accessibility Inspector will remain available until you use the switch to turn it off. However, you can temporarily turn it on/off using the toggle in the corner of the panel (a circle with an X). When you use iOS Simulator you can mimic touch gestures with a mouse. A single click simulates a tap, and scrolling simulates flicking or dragging. With Accessibility Inspector turned on, a different set of gesture replacements is used:  Single click Selects a control. Double click Activates the selected control.  Dragging or flicking can’t be simulated with Accessibility Inspector running. You need to temporarily disable it (toggle the close control in the upper left of the panel), then scroll the mouse to the desired location before enabling Accessibility Inspector again. In the Accessibility Inspector panel you’ll find two types of information: properties and notifications. Accessibility properties You can examine the accessible label, value, hint (if available), accessibility traits and frame co-ordinates for each control. As you update your code the changes are reflected in real time, helping you experiment with different solutions. Accessibility notifications Notifications are messages that keep VoiceOver up-to-date with what’s happening in your app. For example, you might use UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification to notify VoiceOver users when some information appears briefly on screen. Used in combination, testing with VoiceOver and debugging with Accessibility Inspector is an effective approach. For example, you might discover an unidentified control during testing. Using the Accessibility Inspector you can examine the control to make sure it has an accessible label and that the relevant traits have been enabled.

Use the Accessibility Inspector in XCode and iOS simulator A short video tutorial by Ted Drake   Learning by involving people with disabilities in user research  Posted on Monday, 12 December 2016 by David Sloan  Category: UX   One of the most exciting things about 2016 has been the growth in number of user-research projects that we’ve worked on with our clients. User research is about discovering and defining problems as early as possible, and figuring out how best to address them through design and development. In contrast, an accessibility audit involves us using a set of standards to look for existing, pre-defined problems in a live or nearly complete site or app. We’ve designed and run several user-research studies this year where we spent time gathering information from people with disabilities to inform a design and development project. For example, we’ve led projects that focused on:  Gathering details of how people with disabilities experience physical and digital learning environments, and involving them in reviewing the current version of an online learning environment that will be redesigned. Informing research and development of a virtual-reality product, which alters users’ field of vision, by talking to people with visual impairments about their approach to mobility and navigation. Collecting perspectives from people who use screen readers about a new accessibility feature in a mobile app. Evaluating prototype webpage designs with people with disabilities as part of an iterative development process.  We’ll always have a purpose in mind for our work, especially when we conduct usability evaluations with a focus on task completion, and require a standard protocol to follow. But for more exploratory research, our approach usually encourages loosely defined discussions rather than rigid interviews, conversations led by participants rather than us, and face-to-face interactions rather than remote conversations whenever possible. What might you learn? What can you expect when conducting user research with people with disabilities? Based on our experience, you might gain:  A richer understanding of a problem space from a different perspective. Potential users with disabilities contribute as active participants, rather than being considered by the design team only as abstract beneficiaries of accessibility guidelines. This helps organisations build practical empathy that can positively influence design and help spark innovation. Feedback on what works and what doesn’t. You’ll learn about features that are valued by people with disabilities and examples of good practices to follow (or not to abandon!). This helps isolate the high-priority design problems that you should focus on solving. First-hand experience of people with disabilities talking about and using technology, and the enabling impact it can have on their lives. This helps demystify and humanise accessibility, and provides valuable stories that can be recorded and reused to educate and motivate.  Inclusive design thinking In this work, we’re partnering with organisations to extend thinking about disability and accessibility to what Dan Nessler identified as the “diverging” phases of the design-thinking process. These are the discover/research and develop/ideation phases, which involve opening up rather than condensing ideas and discoveries. (Nessler’s Medium article: How to apply a design thinking, HCD, UX or any creative process from scratch provides a helpful overview of these phases and how they fit into a wider design thinking approach). Approaching accessibility in this way is a strong sign of an organisation making progress towards accessible design maturity. In turn, one of the most valuable outcomes—and why we love doing this kind of work—is the change in the dynamic between the people who are producing the technology and the people who are using it. We’re involving people with disabilities as partners in research and design—rather than as test pilots sent out to find flaws and barriers after a product has already been created. And when organisations integrate design thinking and inclusive design, that makes better products and services for everyone.  Global Considerations in Creating an Organizational  Web Accessibility Policy  Posted on Wednesday, 16 April 2014 by David Sloan  Category: Strategy   TPG’s Accessible User Experience team recently did some work for a client exploring legislation and standards on digital accessibility in selected countries around the world, and their impact on defining an organizational accessibility policy for globally-active organizations.  In particular, since we didn’t have time to conduct an exhaustive review, we were interested in discovering how easy it was to find authoritative national digital accessibility policy information that organizations could act on. We wrote about our findings in a paper that we presented at the Web For All (W4A) 2014 conference in Seoul.  Here’s the text of our paper, amended slightly from the original to include additional hyperlinks for ease of online reading.  Abstract Awareness of the nature and implication of legislation and policy regarding web accessibility in different countries is important in guiding organizational web accessibility policy. Our review of published legislation and supporting documentation relating to disability rights and digital accessibility in five countries—Australia, Brazil, China, India and South Africa—reveals diversity in the nature and extent of legislation and policy, but offers some indication of trends that could inform a global web accessibility policy. Introduction Widespread recognition of the contribution of ICT, and the web in particular, towards promoting social inclusion and reducing discrimination of people with disabilities is reflected in legislation and policy across the world. For organizations authoring or providing web content and applications intended for international use, there is a complex challenge in defining an accessibility policy and strategy that is sensitive to the diversity of cultural, technical and legislative situations that may exist in different target markets [4]. This challenge is exacerbated when one considers the efforts required to create and maintain high-quality translated versions of content—and its accessible equivalents. To help define a pragmatic and locally-sensitive global accessibility strategy, we argue that an essential first step is to understand the nature and diversity of the legislative situation with regard to digital accessibility, for example the extent to which guidelines such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) feature in national policy. In this paper, we describe observations of a short study of the legislative environment for digital accessibility in five selected countries, and identify some trends and implications on developing and implementing a global digital accessibility strategy. A Global View Before considering each territory in turn, we give an overview of key global treaties that have influenced, or are likely to influence, territory policy and legislation. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) For many countries, particularly those in the developing world, disability legislation and policy has been driven by the commitments made when the country ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) [8], which was adopted in 2006 and entered into force on 2008. The terms of the treaty are likely to form the basis of any new legislation and policy or changes to existing legislation relating to the rights of people with disabilities to participate in public life, including access to education, access to technology and digital content, and to copyrighted content. Of relevance to digital accessibility in the UN CRPD is a recurring theme of a commitment to Universal Design, with further emphasis of the contribution that ICT can make in improving accessibility of information, services and experiences to people with disabilities. Article 9 (Accessibility) obliges signatories to promote access for people with disabilities to new information and communications technologies and systems, including the Internet, and to promote accessibility early and throughout the technology development lifecycle. Articles 21, 24 and 30 deal with access to web-based services, education and cultural life respectively. UN records show 158 ratifications of the UN CRPD, as at January 2014, though notably this does not include the US. Additionally, the Global Initiative for Inclusive Information and Communication Technologies (G3ict) provide summary data on adoption with relevance to ICT accessibility, which indicates that, amongst countries surveyed, web sites and television are most common ICTs addressed [2]. The WIPO Marrakesh Treaty A significant concern of global digital accessibility is the difficulty in access to copyrighted content by people who, for reasons of disability, are unable to access the content in its original printed format. The unavailability of accessible format content is often due to copyright limitations that make it prohibitively expensive or time-consuming—or unlawful—to create and distribute accessible formats. To address this challenge, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) published The Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled on June 27, 2013 [9]. The Treaty specifically addresses the need for copyright legislation to provide necessary exceptions to facilitate creation and distribution of accessible format copies of published works. The Treaty focuses on people with print disabilities as beneficiaries, and defines this as including:  people who are blind; people who have a visual or reading disability (including dyslexia) that prevents them from having equivalent access to printed published content; people with physical impairments that make it difficult or impossible to hold a book.  The provisions of the Treaty acknowledge the advances in technology that facilitate easier creation and distribution of accessible formats. They set out a framework for enabling access to these alternative formats, while also recognizing the rights of copyright holders over distribution of their content. So, from a web accessibility perspective, the Treaty can be considered another motivating factor for preparing digital content in a manner such that it can successfully be used by people with print disabilities, including:  Ensuring text can be effectively presented by screen readers and other text-to-speech software, for people who are blind and for people who have difficulty reading. Ensuring that the appearance of text can be customized to enhance readability, for example by changing text and background colors, text size, font, line spacing or justification. Ensuring digital content is navigable when accessed using diverse alternative input devices.  Legislation and Policy Review We considered five territories in conducting this review:  Australia, Brazil, China, India and South Africa. The latter four countries were selected for study as each is an emerging economy where economic growth is globally significant, but the legislative framework for disability equality and digital accessibility can be considered to be still evolving. We note that coverage of the situation in the US and the EU is comprehensive, so, for contrast, we chose Australia as a country with a mature and stable disability rights legal situation, including web accessibility case law, and a prominent and active digital accessibility movement. We conducted a review of publicly available legislation and policy documentation regarding disability rights and digital accessibility, including of copyrighted content, for each of the selected territories during December 2013. Some information gathered was based on third party accounts and automated translations of content not provided in English. Some potentially useful material that is not provided in English may exist but was not found during this research. Nevertheless, the conclusions that follow are based on a principle of diminishing returns—if, after a period of searching, only relatively limited information on digital accessibility and disability equality in a territory, it was concluded that:  There is no such information available, or; There is information available, but it is sufficiently difficult to find by affected organizations that it is at present of relatively limited real-world impact.  Patterns and Trends Based on our findings, we can make some observations on patterns and trends emerging from the policy and legislative situation in the territories reviewed. Disability rights legislation and web accessibility Existence of disability rights legislation: All territories have legislation intended to protect the rights of people with disabilities. However, despite each territory’s ratification of the UN CRPD, there is significant diversity in the extent, detail and maturity of disability legislation across the territories studied. Definitions of disability and the legal rights of people with disabilities vary across the territories reviewed, but generally focuses on rights to access basic public information and services. Status and evolution of disability rights legislation and supporting documentation: Through its Human Rights Commission (HRC), Australia provides details supporting guidance documentation to help organizations meet their obligations under the relevant legislation, the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1992. Brazil has enacted a number of laws and decrees to gradually extend and provide more detail to the rights expressed in its original piece of legislation, Law No. 7853 (1989), protecting the rights of people with disabilities. These include Decree 6949 (2009), which adopts the full terms of the UN CRPD. China modified its disability rights legislation, the Law on Protection of Disabled People, in 2008, after signing of the UN CRPD. The terms of this legislation appear to be aspirational rather than providing details of rights and obligations. India’s disability rights legislation is the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Right and Full Participation) Act 1995, which predates the UN CRPD. There is no clear detail of plans exist to update it to better reflect the terms of the UN CRPD. South Africa does not have a specific item of legislation protecting the rights of people with disabilities; these rights are bound in a more general equality act, the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act 2000. However, the government indicated in 2011 that it plans to draft a disability-specific law, although progress towards fuller adoption of the terms of the UN CRPD is unclear. Reference to technology in disability rights: Each territory formally recognizes the value of technology in reducing inequality for people with disabilities, in legislation or supporting documentation. However, territories differ in the level of definition of the rights of people with disabilities to be able to successfully access and use digital content, products and services; with no obvious mention made in China’s disability rights legislation or in South Africa’s equality legislation. Reference to minimum standards for web accessibility: No territory provides direct reference to technical requirements in legislation for digital accessibility. However, Australia, Brazil and India do provide guidance on a recommended standard for accessibility either by direct reference to WCAG 2.0 or by publication of national web accessibility guidelines. The nature and scope of these standards varies—all cover government web sites, but only Australia provides details of a required standard to be met by non-government web sites. In Brazil, eMAG 3.0 deviates from WCAG 2.0 Level AA by requiring an accessibility toolbar and specific skip navigation to be present on each page, and by omitting some Level AA Success Criteria [5].  Table 1: Web accessibility standards in selected territories   Territory Standard Scope Notes   Australia WCAG 2.0 Level AA Government and non-government web sites Specified in guidance provided by the Human Rights Commission on meeting DDA obligations.   Brazil eMAG 3.0 Government web sites eMAG 3.0 closely follows WCAG 2.0 Level AA, but with some differences.   China None n/a No evidence found of a national standard for web accessibility (but see Note at the end of the paper for an update).   India Guidelines for Indian Government Web sites Government web sites Guideline conformance ensures meeting WCAG 2.0 Level A, but also extend beyond accessibility requirements.   South Africa None n/a No evidence found of a national standard for web accessibility.    In addition to the Guidelines for Indian Government Web sites, the Indian Government approved the National Policy on Electronic Accessibility (PDF) in October 2013 [6]. The Policy sets out objectives for improving accessibility of public and private web sites, and proposes that accessibility standards will be “formulated or adapted from” existing standards, with specific reference is made to W3C accessibility guidelines, including WCAG 2.0, along with the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) and the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). Treatment of non-HTML digital formats: Web accessibility standards and guidance of Australia, Brazil and India all make reference to a preference to providing web content in accessible HTML over other formats. Additionally, there are signs that choosing to rely on PDF as a digital content format will be problematic in some territories. Australia warns against relying on PDF as a document format, while Brazil requires downloadable documents to be available in ODF. This may be evidence of a trend to avoid recommending reliance on proprietary file formats in favor of open formats; there are also known accessibility limitations of PDF in terms of supporting people with some print disabilities in customizing the appearance of text [3]. Advocacy and outreach: Australia has a mature and active community, including private enterprises, academia and the non-profit sector. Elsewhere, the presence of a digital accessibility community is less visible, but there are examples of progress. W3C is active in promoting web accessibility and adoption of W3C standards though regional offices in Australia, Brazil, India and South Africa, and through a Community Group on Accessibility in China. The Techshare India conference, and Brazil’s All@Web, a web accessibility “recognition program” coordinated by the W3C and the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee, are examples of awareness-raising initiatives that may help to raise the profile of web accessibility. Rights to Accessible Copyrighted Content Marrakesh Treaty: Australia, Brazil and China have signed the Marrakesh Treaty. Status and evolution of copyright legislation supporting access to alternative formats: All territories had some form of copyright law, but legal definition of the rights of people with disabilities to receive copyrighted content in accessible format varied across different territories. Australia’s Copyright Amendment Act 2006 updated prior legislation to include provisions for the rights of people with disabilities to receive copyrighted content in alternative formats; the Australian Government has indicated that only minor revisions would be necessary to enable Australia to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty. However, information was scarce on plans to revise existing legislation in Brazil, China, India and South Africa to enable ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty. Brazil’s Copyright Law of 1998 provides some rights for people with visual impairments to reproduce copyrighted content in accessible format.  The Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China (amended 2010) grants no specific rights for people with disabilities to receive or produce copyrighted content in accessible format. China’s Law on Protection of Disabled People (2008) grants basic rights of people with disabilities to access books, but does not give more specific detail on rights to alternative formats. India’s Copyright Amendment Act (2012) amended the Copyright Act (1957) to give some basic provisions for people with disabilities to access copyrighted content in alternative formats. South Africa has a Copyright Act of 1978, but gives no specific rights for people with disabilities to access copyrighted content in alternative formats [7]. However, in representations made to the process of finalizing the Marrakesh Treaty, South Africa indicated that it is reviewing its copyright legislation in advance of signing the Marrakesh Treaty. Implications for an Organizational Global Accessibility Policy Based on the findings of this study, we present some implications on organizations wishing to define and implement a global digital accessibility policy. Slow convergence: Disability equality legislation and policy, particularly with respect to digital content and services and access to copyrighted content, may evolve slowly in individual territories, but is likely to converge over time as territories recognize and formalize their obligations as adopters of the UN CRPD and the Marrakesh Treaty. Focus on print disability: Legal definitions of disability may vary across different territories, but the definition of print disability defined in the Marrakesh Treaty may cause legal definitions of disability to be revised as part of the process of ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty, and this definition should be accommodated in global policy. Organizational policy should extend digital accessibility obligations beyond accommodating visual impairment through ensuring logical and comprehensible audio output of content to include reading difficulties relating to cognitive and motor impairment. This should include a focus on supporting flexibility of text customization, compatibility with different reading and input devices, and minimizing physical effort in interaction. Prominence of WCAG 2.0: Whilst not ubiquitous in national legislation or standards, signs are that providing web content that meets WCAG 2.0 Level AA will ensure the content also meets standards for web accessibility across different territories. Therefore, organizational policy that references WCAG 2.0 as its measure of web content accessibility is likely to be more globally relevant. Limitations of PDF accessibility: The review identified instances where reliance on the provision of content in proprietary data formats, particularly PDF, is likely to be problematic from a standards or legal compliance perspective. This is, of course, a small sample, but should be considered a sign of a relationship between global digital accessibility standards and access to open source formats, particularly in territories where economic conditions may encourage adoption of open source solutions. Organizations that use PDF should develop a policy for acquiring, generating and publishing accessible PDF content, and also ensuring accessible alternatives are available. Looking forward, it would be prudent to reduce reliance on PDF by establishing a policy that all new content in presented in an open source format, such as accessible HTML. Capacity for monitoring global developments: Disability rights legislation and policy around the world is dynamic; and the connections between disability rights and the role technology can play in reducing (or exacerbating) inequality can sometimes be misunderstood or underestimated. Organizations should develop internal capacity through dedicated staff to scope, document and monitor the legislative and policy situation in other key territories, and share this knowledge strategically in order to anticipate and meet relevant obligations it is likely to be placed under; and take advantage of market opportunities in terms of the provision of accessible digital content, services and experiences that such a situation may offer. Conclusion In this study of the situation in key global markets we have presented a perspective from an accessibility consultancy rather than a forensic examination by a corporate legal team. Nevertheless we offer a viewpoint that we believe will help a multi-nationally active organization looking to understand and act on the global digital accessibility legal landscape. As expected, the situation in Australia is the most detailed in terms of publicly available requirements for delivering digital accessibility; though there is significant activity in Brazil and India. Our findings indicate that, for organizations looking to define a global digital accessibility policy, there are some signs of convergence of legal and technical requirements, particularly in regard to definition of the rights of people with disabilities, and in terms of WCAG 2.0 conformance. However, progress towards a mature and consistent global definition and recognition of web accessibility—and, even, disability itself—still appears to be some way off; and further detail of progress in these and other territories is needed in order to provide a more detailed understanding of the situation. That said, restricting digital accessibility strategy to achieving technical compliance within a specific country is unlikely to lead to a sufficiently positive experience for people with disabilities, given the focus of legislation on equal access to information and basic services. Balancing designing for accessibility out-of-the-box with flexibility of customization is a key underpinning requirement of a forward looking organizational accessibility strategy.

We expect most of the sessions to be up in the next couple of weeks. We’ll be sure to keep you posted. Thanks again for your support. We’re already looking forward to #ID24 in 2015!!! Best, Mike Mike Paciello The Paciello Group | phone: 603.882.4122 ext 103 | mobile: 603.566.7713 Founder, Partner  Supporting the next generation of accessible technology developers  Posted on Friday, 20 September 2013 by David Sloan  Category: Strategy   This weekend sees the European final of the SS12 Coding for a Cause competition, where teams of university and college students compete to produce the best piece of accessible software. It’s a terrific opportunity for students to develop and demonstrate skills in inclusive design and development. In my previous job, I co-ordinated Dundee University’s involvement by running a local competition earlier this year; now, as a TPG employee, I work for the competition sponsors. Putting aside any conflict of interest in the outcome of the EU final (it’s OK, I’m not a judge!), this article provides some background to the competition.  Education is often cited as the key to ensuring that the next generation of technology developers build in accessibility as a core attribute, rather than as an afterthought, if at all. Most importantly, we need to teach accessibility and inclusive design in context – thinking about people with diverse needs from the earliest point and throughout the design lifecycle, appreciating the role of assistive technology in the accessibility jigsaw, and ensuring that accommodating diversity becomes standard practice in design and development through excellent technical and user research skills. There are many great efforts to encourage computer science, web development, digital interaction design and other relevant courses to embrace accessibility in the curriculum – such as the Interact with Web Standards curriculum and the work of the W3C Web Education Community Group. SS12 has been devised by the non-profit Project Possibility organisation as a competition to specifically reward excellence in accessibility through a project-based competition which encourages teams of students to develop software, a web site or app that seeks to solve an accessibility challenge and itself reaches a high level of accessibility. Institutions run local competitions, usually following a hack weekend-type format, and the local competition winners go head-to-head in a Grand Final, typically held in conjunction with an accessibility-focused conference. SS12 has been running in the US for a few years, and has recently branched out into Europe and Asia. This year, the European project was run on a slightly different basis, to accommodate scheduling constraints experienced by interested universities – using existing learning activities as a means of assessment. Since the University of Dundee’s School of Computing has for a long time emphasised the importance of designing for human diversity in teaching and research, I decided this year that Dundee should participate, and chose to use the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) module I co-ordinated as a basis for our competition. We were also very lucky that Powermapper Software generously agreed to sponsor the Dundee competition, by providing funds to enable to the winning team to travel to the final, held in conjunction with the AAATE 2013 conference in Vilamoura, Portugal. The HCI module, taken by third year students on Bachelor of Science degree programs, includes a semester-long team project activity his year, the brief was “Intergenerational Communication”, and the students were encouraged to apply a user-centred, inclusive design process to create an application which included older people as a core audience. The SS12 competition assessment was kept separate from the  academic assessment, and student teams could choose whether or not to participate. In the end, three project teams nominated themselves for the award, judged by Mark Rogers, CEO of Powermapper and Professor Alan Newell, former head of the School of Computing and pioneering accessibility researcher. The winning team of Heather Ellis, Yolina Kostova and Candice Stewart produced a web site supporting older people in using digital photos to share stories with their family and friends. As a sponsor of SS12 EU, TPG offers its congratulations to all the competition participants and organisers in working to raise the profile of e-accessibility as a key professional skill, and especially to the winning teams from each of the participating universities – Université Paris 8, Masaryk University, Technical University of Košice, University of Dundee and Johannes Kepler University Linz. And the Winners are… Updated 21st September: Congratulations to the team from Johannes Kepler University (JKU), who were announced today as winners of SS12 EU 2013, for their project on a touch tablet Braille keyboard.

US Access Board to Hold Technology Listening Sessions in Chicago  Posted on Friday, 24 September 2010 by Mike Paciello  Category: News   Received e-mail from Tim Creagan of the US Access Board regarding the following special event. Encourage all Chicago-based accessibility and disability friends to participate: Disability and accessibility colleagues in the Chicago area are encouraged by the US Access Board to attend and speak at a special Listening Session on September 30, 2010 from 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Central Time. The Listening session is designed to elicit comments about what the Federal Government can do to use technology in new and better ways, and to influence technology accessibility.  This is a joint effort of the Chief Information Officers Council, the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, the Office of Government-wide Policy of the General Services Administration and the Access Board. This listening session is being conducted in response to a memo dated July 19, 2010 from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on “Improving the Accessibility of Government Information” and signed by Vivek Kundra. As you know, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to buy and use electronic and information technology (EIT) that is accessible. The July memo directs agencies to take stronger steps toward improving the acquisition and implementation of accessible technology. In order to better understand the needs of diverse communities and provide better solutions, the U.S. Council of CIOs, in collaboration with the Chief Acquisition Officers Council, the GSA Office of Governmentwide Policy and the U.S. Access Board, is holding the first in a series of listening sessions to engage citizens and employees in expressing concerns and proposing ideas. DETAILS ABOUT THE LISTENING SESSION: Public Forum on Information Technology in the Federal Sector (Sept. 30, 1:30 p.m. to  4:30 p.m. Central Time) As part of a new administration initiative, members of the Chief Information Officers Council and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council will join the Board in conducting the first in a series of listening sessions on ways to promote access to information technology (IT) in the Federal sector under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Questions to be explored through this session include: •    What can the federal government do to use technology in new and better ways and to influence technology accessibility? •    What can technology do to improve access and opportunities for people with disabilities and enhance their interaction with the federal government? •    Are there emerging technologies being used by the federal government that people feel left out of? •    What can the federal government do to make technology more accessible? Members of the public are invited to attend the session to offer their ideas for improving IT accessibility or to share access concerns. Feedback from this session and future ones will be shared with responsible agencies to implement improvements. For more information, contact Kathy Johnson at johnson@access-board.gov, (202) 272-0041, or (202) 272-0082 (TTY). MORE DETAILS: Meeting Location: The listening session will be held at the Courtyard by Marriott Magnificent Mile Hotel, Courtyard Marriott Magnificent Mile 165 East Ontario Street, Chicago, IL 60611 in the Ontario B & C rooms. Accommodations: The listening session will have sign language interpreters; CART (real time captioning) services, Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs), microphones and materials will be available in Braille, large print and electronic formats. The hotel is wheelchair accessible. Anyone needing other accommodations should include a specific request when registering in advance. NOTE:  We are unable to provide remote “listening-in” capability at this first listening session.  At least 3 more listening sessions are planned around the country (one will be in Washington, DC in December at the IDEAS conference) so there will be other opportunities to comment.  Advisory Committee Presents Report on Updated 508 Standards  Posted on Tuesday, 8 April 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Standards   On April 3, the Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory Committee (TEITAC) presented its report to the Access Board on updating accessibility criteria for information and communication technologies. The committees report recommends revisions to the Board’s standards for electronic and information technology covered by section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. It also addresses updates to guidelines for telecommunications products issued by the Board under section 255 of the Telecommunication Act. â€œWe firmly believe that the recommendations of this report will lead to new versions of the standards and guidelines that comprehensively cover accessibility in a dynamic and innovative marketplace,â€\\x9d stated Mike Paciello of the Paciello Group who co-chaired the committee. Co-chair Jim Tobias of Inclusive Technologies concurred, noting that â€œthis committee, through the incredible range of expertise and talent it enlisted, indeed rose to the challenge and was not shy in confronting a host of complex issues before it.â€\\x9d Further Reading:  Advisory Committee Presents Report on Updated 508 Standards Refreshed Accessibility Standards and Guidelines in Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology   W4A 2015: Improving Accessibility of the Web, Mobiles and Wearables!

I am psyched about going to Florence!! TPG will again sponsor the Accessibility Challenge. The information that follows came directly to me from Yevgen Borodin, one of the conference organizers: We encourage you to submit your best work on improving accessibility of the Web, Mobiles, and Wearables for people with and without disabilities to the International Web for All Conference (W4A’15), conveniently co-located with WWW’15 and MobiSys’15. W4A’15 (www.w4a.info) will take place in Florence, Italy (May 18-20):  IBM will provide travel grants to both grad and undergrad students with disabilities Google will sponsor 6 PhD students to participate in the Doctoral Student Consortium Intuit will award $2,000 and $1,000 to the best technical and communication papers The Paciello Group (TPG) will give awards to the winners of the Accessibility Challenge  Please note that Submission deadlines: Jan 23rd, Notifications: March 4th As you know, devices are getting smaller, and more of them are now wearable: smart glasses, smart watches, and smart clothing are all working their way into our lives and onto our bodies. These devices are online, web-accessible, and increasingly interconnected. As with many technologies that have come before, wearable devices present incredible opportunities for improving accessibility for people with and without disabilities, but also present accessibility challenges in ensuring that people are able to equally benefit from them regardless of disability, context or situation. Acknowledging the importance of this topic, the theme of the 12th International Web for All Conference is “The Wearable Web”. Don’t be deterred by the theme; we invite your best work on improving and understanding access for people across the accessibility continuum. Papers are expected to detail technical solutions and scientific insights into Web, Mobile, and Wearable technologies addressing diverse user needs. Areas of interest include but are not limited to the following: age, cognition, culture, education, emotions, dexterity, disability, diversity, health, hearing, income, infrastructure, language, learning, literacy, mobility, situation, society, and vision. The main keynote on the “Sense and sensibility: smartphones and wearable technologies to support seniors” will be delivered by Lorenzo Chiari who is a Professor and the Vice-Director of the Health Sciences and Technologies – Interdepartmental Center for Industrial Research at the University of Bologna. At the close of the 1st day, join us for the evening of wine, food, and live music. The “William Laughborough” after-dinner talk “Sense and sensibility: smartphones and wearable technologies to support seniors” will be given by Kevin Carey, the Chair of the Royal National Institute of Blind People, UK. Don’t come just for W4A’15 – stay for the entire week! W4A is conveniently co-located with WWW’15 and MobiSys’15 conferences. WWW’15 (http://www.www2015.it/) is the best and the biggest Web research conference attended by famous Web researchers and practitioners, such as Sir Tim Berners-Lee (the inventor of the Web). MobiSys’15 is the top research conference dealing with all aspects of mobile systems: http://www.sigmobile.org/mobisys/2015/cfp.php.

Posted on Wednesday, 21 March 2012 by Mike Paciello  Category: Strategy   Last week, Jamie and Mick of NVDA announced that their open source, free screen reader organization is in need of funding: Blind Ambition Plea for Funds to Keep Free Software Project Alive NVDA is perhaps the cream of the crop when it comes to web accessibility for blind users. The user experience is equally terrific. TPG uses NVDA as part of it’s quality assurance testing for all web properties. In short, we need to do something to “Save the NVDA” so to speak. Spark a campaign if you will. Having said that, my general interest involves platform support, specifically desktop and mobile. I’ve read the product specification. Still, I’d like to get the inside scoop from the user community. I’d like to reach out to the general community (not to mention Mick and Jamie!) to get a better sense of the user experience. Would you be kind enough to respond to this blog and share your thoughts? Thanks!  The Paciello Group and Tenon Announce  Partnership  Posted on Tuesday, 14 July 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: News Tag: Tenon   PRESS RELEASE Brian Landrigan Director of Sales Marketing The Paciello Group blandrigan@paciellogroup.com +1 603-882-4122          Nashua, NH – July 14, 2015 – The Paciello Group (TPG) and Tenon, LLC today announce a sales and marketing partnership that delivers world-class automated testing for accessibility in conformance with governmental and web guidelines. These guidelines include the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Version 2 (WCAG 2.0) and Section 508 requirements. In today’s diverse environment, the Internet is becoming the dominant location for people with disabilities to find information and to transact business. It is vitally important for businesses, educational institutions, and governmental agencies to take appropriate steps to ensure their sites and applications are accessible to all visitors. The Paciello Group believes that the Tenon.io tool is the preeminent automated testing software to identify accessibility issues without the “clutter” of false positive reporting. Mike Paciello, founder and president of TPG observes, “We have long believed that manual testing is the most effective method to uncover complex accessibility issues within web, mobile and software environments. Because our clients have come to expect a high level of integrity in TPG’s quality assurance (QA) analysis, we have traditionally avoided automated testing tools. However, with Tenon, we now have a tool that integrates well with existing client installed QA applications, includes the flexibility of accommodating cross-platform plug-ins and complements the software quality assurance manual testing process. We are thrilled to partner with the Tenon team and to be offering Tenon.io to our clients.” The Paciello Group and Tenon are partnering to ensure the highest level of accessibility services. Tenon will continue to offer software as a service via their website, tenon.io. Partnering with The Paciello Group allows Tenon to offer custom installations to select TPG clients. “Our guiding principle has always been ‘Accessibility for All,’” notes Tenon co-founder Asa Baylus. “Partnering with TPG expands our market and makes that a reality.” About Tenon Tenon.io debuted in March 2015 and immediately garnered an impressive list of Fortune 500 customers. Founded by Karl Groves, an international leader in web accessibility standards and compliance, and Asa Baylus, a well-known developer and user-interface designer, Tenon’s industry-disruptive software seeks to establish a new standard for accessibility testing. Tenon’s guiding principle is and always has been “Accessibility for All.” This means integrating accessibility testing into developer workflow, reducing false-positives to maximize efficiency, benchmarking tests one step ahead of international standards, and finding ways to reach developers traditionally shut out of the automated testing market. About The Paciello Group Headquartered in Nashua, NH, USA, we work with organizations around the world, including government agencies, technology vendors, companies in industries including publishing, finance, and healthcare, and educational institutions.

Sucking on WCAG 2.0  Posted on Friday, 6 June 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: News Tag: HTMLTag: WCAG   While at @media I had the opportunity to meet up with Lachlan Hunt, who works at Opera and is a fellow W3C HTML5 working group member. He did a short interview with me for standardssuck.org, asking some questions about WCAG 2.0, the almost minted W3C specification, designed to provide guidance on how to build web sites and web applications that are accessible and usable by people with disabilities. Note: I had limited coherence at this point (at the end of the conference after a few drinks). Lachlan  made reference in his questions to Joe Clark’s criticisms of WCAG 2 in his article, from 2006 – To Hell with WCAG 2 . Below are some comments that Joe made in an interview with Jeremy Keith at @media 2007, after his article was published. “Now, to their credit, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group read and responded to absolutely every objection to the first draft of WCAG 2. Every single one, they didn’t skip any, and they tried to do something to address all of them… I read the two changes documents, which show that there has been tremendous improvement…” Interview Transcript  Lachlan:  Hi I’m Lachlan Hunt here for standardssuck.org. (gestures with his fist clenched except for the index and little fingers which are outstretched. ) That’s our sign. I’m here with Steve Faulkner from The Paciello Group, is that right?  Steve: thats right. Lachlan: We’re here to talk about the WCAG 2 specification. So, tell us what is WCAG 2? Steve: WCAG 2 is the next generation of the web content accessibility guidelines. Lachlan: Okay and what does that involve? well what is accessibility? well what is web accessibility? what is the purpose of these guidelines? Steve: To help people make web sites and web applications accessible to people with disabilities. That’s my take on it anyway. Lachlan: How has it changed from WCAG 1? Is it an improvement or… Steve: Hopefully, it is definitely an improvement, they’ve taken seven years to do it and they have had lots and lots of input from lots and lots of people so hopefully there’s an improvement. The main difference is that it attempts to be a lot more technology neutral and also it attempts to deal with a lot of the issues that are more prevalent today. I mean, the web moved on since – what – it was nine year ago or whatever since they first came out ,1999, and the web has moved on a lot. the way people use the web and interact with the web has moved on and it has to come to terms with those challenges. I think in the end, although it is not a perfect document, there are still issues with it as far as cognitive disabilities are concerned (for example). It’s a big improvement on WCAG 1 and yeah, it contains a lot of good information about how to make web sites and web application accessible, which is what it tries to do. Lachlan: OK, Joe Clark wrote an article on a listapart called ‘To Hell with WCAG 2’ a year or two ago and he complained a lot about things in WCAG 2, he said the spec was basically unreadable and didin’t cover all these issues. What was you take on that? Steve: Well as i said previously, I think Joe had a lot of good points about the spec at that point, but it went through a couple of ‘last calls’ or whatever they’re called: processes within the W3C where people can, the public can make comment, and there was literally thousands of comments, and the comments that Joe made formed part of that and , one the issues you talked about, the use of language, they really worked on that so it is a lot easier to read. It’s more human readable than it was. I think some of these issues were peripheral or issues that clouded the strengths of the document itself, and once they cleaned those up it shined up quite well. Lachlan: OK, Joe also started the WCAG Samuri, shortly after he wrote that article and he has since released a lot of errata for the WCAG 1 specification, what did you think of those? Were they good and what did you think of the way they were developed, in secret? Steve: It was all a bit cloak and dagger, I mean, it was dramatic wasn’t it? A certain drama and melodrama about the whole thing. The resulting document was quite interstesting, there are a lot of good points, but I think, in a way, it has not had a huge impact, because it was a document that was developed outside the W3C and for better or worse the W3C has some credibility as far as these things are concerned and governments Â and corporations around the world tend to take the WCAG guidelines as a benchmark, where as something such as the WCAG samuri may contain interesting or good information, is not going to be taken on as a benchmark. Where as I think, again WCAG 2 will. Lachlan: OK thanks steve, it has been a pleasure talking to you. Steve: Is that it? Lachlan: You’ve got more to say? Steve: Yes, i would like to say, it has been great to meet Lachlan in person, and its’s nice to be with a fellow Australian. Lachlan: Hey I forgot to say, we are here in London at the @media conference, yeah I met up with him yersterday and we decided to do this, so hope you enjoyed it. This has been Lachlan Hunt and Steve faulkner for StandardsSuck.org (makes the standardssuck gesture with hand). Steve:  See Ya!

WCAG 2.1: Success Criteria for Cognitive Disabilities  Posted on Thursday, 1 March 2018 by Kurt Mattes  Category: Standards   Updated March 2, 2018 to clarify the genesis of Success Criteria included in this post. Updated July 28, to correct SC numbers and links. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 is in the final phase to become a W3C Recommendation and that means the web is about to begin accommodating the cognitive needs of many more people. WCAG 2.1 is the first version to specifically address UI and UX designs some people find too difficult to comprehend or too complex to use. In particular, eleven of the new Success Criteria will result in making the web more inclusive and adaptable for a broader range of human memory, problem solving, and attention abilities. They also expand the spectrum of human reading, linguistic, verbal, math, and visual comprehension necessary to enjoy a rich, productive experience. As has been the case since WCAG 1.0, Success Criteria developed for one community of people with disabilities can also benefit people from other communities. Only 4 of the new Success Criteria were born out of the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Task Force (COGA.) They are 1.3.5, 1.3.6, 2.2.6, and 2.2.7. The remaining Success Criteria discussed below were crafted by the Mobile and the Low Vision task forces, yet they have potential benefits for people with cognitive impairments. Likewise, Success Criterion 1.3.5 from COGA paves the way for new technologies to provide people with low vision who turn off images more than just the alternative text information for comprehending the image’s purpose. In the Candidate Recommendation dated January 30, 2018, two of these 11 Success Criteria are at Level A and six are at Level AA. For organizations wishing to reach for Level AAA, three additional Success Criteria are covered at the end of this post.   WCAG A/AA/AAA Conformance levels explained Level A Success Criterion 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures Web content which interprets pointer gestures must be operable with single-point activation and must not require a complicated or complex path-based gesture. An exception is provided for essential multi-point or path-based gestures. Comprehending or remembering gestures involving the use of more than one point of contact or a particular motion is difficult, and in some cases impossible for a person to do. Sliders are one type of content where a specific motion is necessary for interaction. Making the same functionality available by tapping anywhere along the slider or by tapping buttons to move the slider would satisfy this Success Criterion. Likewise, a screen that can be unlocked by drawling a pattern among dots in a 3 by 3 grid can also be unlocked by tapping on the dots in the same order or tapping on numbers. Success Criterion 2.6.1 Motion Actuation When device or user motion can trigger functionality, the same functionality must also be available via user interface components AND a means to disable the motion trigger must be provided. The intent of this Success Criterion is to avoid relying only on motion for functionality and to avoid accidental or unintentional activation of the functionality. The motion ability some people have may not allow them to make the necessary motion to trigger the functionality. Likewise, a condition like cerebral palsy can cause uncontrollable motion which should not inadvertently trigger functionality. Similar to gestures, remembering specific motions or comprehending the association between device or user motion and functionality can be difficult to impossible for people with limited cognitive abilities. Likewise, it can be disconcerting or unsettling when functionality is triggered and the user does not know how it happened. Two exceptions are provided:  The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface The motion is essential for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity  Level AA Success Criterion 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose Automatically suggesting responses or populating form fields is one of the newest features provided by some user agents like browsers. This functionality is very helpful for people who have a hard time remembering, transcribing or copying information as well as those prone to making spelling mistakes or misreading labels. This success criteria requires the author to add an autocomplete attribute to form elements so that user agents know what they do, and then can add appropriate extra support. The value of this attribute contains either a single token with the word “off” or “on”, or an ordered set of space-separated tokens defined in the HTML 5.2 specification. Tokens define expected user input, like “username”, “shipping street-address”, or “billing street-address”. In one case, the tokens serve a slightly different purpose. The one exception occurs when the input element has a type=hidden attribute. In this case, the tokens provide the meaning of the form element’s value. This Success Criterion applies when the purpose or meaning of the form element maps to at least one of the tokens and technologies used to provide the content support the autocomplete attribute. Success Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow Vertical scrolling is required to see all of the content on most web pages. It is the norm and only problematic in rare cases like bottom-less, infinitely loading pages or when a parallax effect occurs. Horizontal scrolling is uncommon to the point of being considered taboo by some designers. That said, certain types of content, such as a large chart or table, cannot be presented without requiring horizontal scrolling. By itself, horizontal scrolling does not present a major problem, especially if enough cues are provided to indicate more content is available by scrolling horizontally. A page requiring both vertical and horizontal scrolling when the content is rendered at its original size is extremely rare and difficult for many users to navigate. Difficult becomes impossible for some people with limited vision or cognitive abilities. They can become ‘lost’ within the content, unable to maintain a sense of meaning conveyed by context or unable to remember where specific content is located on the page. While there are exceptions, this Success Criterion seeks to prevent two-dimensional scrolling when content is enlarged up to 400% of the original size. The abilities some people have require content to be enlarged just to see it well enough to read it or correctly perceive an image. In other cases, content is enlarged to reduce the amount of information displayed down to a level that is not overwhelming or to increase the white space between sentences and words.  Content with vertical scrolling must reflow in a way that avoids horizontal scrolling when the content is reduced to “a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels“. Content with horizontal scrolling must reflow in a way that avoids vertical scrolling when the content is reduced to “a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels”.  Any parts of the content where interaction or comprehension requires both horizontal and vertical scrolling is excepted. Success Criterion 1.4.12 Text Spacing Text content provided by markup languages where the text style is determined by properties such as font, color, size, padding, etc. falls under this Success Criterion. The style properties may originate from the user agent, author provided styles, or styles set by the user. On some web pages, people with conditions like dyslexia, dyscalculia or those who have difficulty remaining focused or reading, as well as people with vision difficulties, are more able to read text when spacing changes are made. The intent of this Success Criterion is to prevent inhibiting the opportunity to make specific spacing changes. When applicable, the content or functionality must experience no loss when any or all of the following changes are made, and no other style changes are required to avoid the loss.  Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size  An exception is provided for languages and scripts where any or all of these properties are not available for use. In those cases, text conforms when any of the properties which can be used satisfies the applicable requirement listed above. Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus When hovering or focusing on content triggers the addition or removal of other content,  A way to reverse the action without moving the pointer or focus location must be provided. This requirement does not apply to input error content, or when the additional content does not obscure or replace existing content. The additional content displayed by hovering must remain visible while the pointer is moved over it. The additional content must remain visible unless an action causes the hover or focus to be removed, the user takes a specific action to dismiss it, or the content is no longer applicable.  Some people lack the cognitive ability to comprehend or not be disrupted by content that seems to mysteriously appear and disappear when they didn’t expect the change, or do anything to cause the change. An exception is provided when the user agent controls displaying the additional content and the author has not modified it. Success Criterion 2.5.4 Concurrent Input Mechanisms Input modalities provided by a platform cannot be restricted by web content unless:  It is an essential restriction; Security of the content would be jeopardized without the restriction; or, It is necessary to preserve user settings.  Consistency and habits are critically important components for some peoples abilities to effectively engage web content. It can be disorienting or impossible to interact with the content when expected input modalities do not work as usual or at all. Success Criterion 2.6.2 Orientation Content, rendered on a device where orientation of the device changes the content’s display, cannot be restricted to only display in one orientation. An exception is provided if a specific orientation is essential such as displaying a check or piano keyboard. Some people need to see information in a single field of vision, like portrait view on a cell phone, to comprehend it, avoid becoming overwhelmed by too much content, or not become distracted. Level AAA Success Criterion 1.3.6 Identify Purpose  Does an “X” icon mean close or delete? Does a magnifying glass icon mean search or zoom? Close, delete, search, zoom, download, save, email, open menu and many more are all tasks commonly seen on webpages. Each may be represented by any one of a variety of icons, including new icons like the hamburger menu introduced on smart phones. User interface components represented by graphics are not an effective means of communication for some people. They are unable to comprehend or recall what it does or are only able to understand a specific set of icons. The purpose of all user interface controls and regions must also be identified in a programmatically determinable way. The intent of this SC is to allow purpose information to be obtainable in multiple modalities. It is a precursor for technologies designed to accommodate personalization, giving the end user more control over their experience. Success Criterion 2.2.6 Timeouts SC 2.2.8 adds a requirement for cases where an inactivity timeout can result in loss of data. To satisfy this SC, the user must be informed about “the estimated length of inactivity that generates the data loss, unless the data is preserved for a minimum of 20 hours of user inactivity.” SC 2.2.7 Animation from Interactions Motion animation, the illusion of movement like sliding content onto a screen, content expanding out from a tiny dot on the screen, or parallax scrolling, is a form of animation that can be distracting or trigger a vestibular disorder, resulting in nausea and headaches. When user interaction can result in motion animation, it must be possible to disable the animation unless it “is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed.” Note: It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content. – source: WCAG 2.1 Conformance Level    The Viking and The Lumberjack: Accessibility in the Real World  Posted on Wednesday, 3 June 2015 by Billy Gregory  Category: News    Think accessibility is just for people with disabilities?

With Audio Description   Easy steps for including disabled people in your workforce  Posted on Wednesday, 28 June 2017 by Matt Ater  Category: Strategy   Are you tapping into the valued and valuable workforce of people with disabilities? Over my 20 years in accessibility I have seen over and over that organizations are not prepared for employing people with disabilities.  The question is why?  Well, the answer is usually as simple as, they didn’t plan.  Now, this seems easy to fix.  In fact, it is.  Project planning skills will be handy. Assemble a Team of Stakeholders Just like any plan, you need resources and a team to implement. Obviously start with the human resources department and make sure they are fully and positively engaged in the success of this plan. Next, be sure the hiring manager is on board and committed to owning the success of the hire. Enlist the IT department to ensure accessibility of tools and integration and support for assistive technology. And, don’t forget to involve the folks responsible for purchasing to make sure they understand the need to buy accessible tech and services. Be sure to bring in the people who carry out training so that they can address accessibility issues before the person with a disability starts. As I’ll discuss below, this is a critical, and often overlooked part of onboarding. Finally, of course, you need to bring in the legal department or adviser and not just for completing a “compliance check list,” but to help craft a plan that ensures the whole organization understands and embraces responsibility for success. Steps to Success Next ensure you address all the steps necessary for successful employment, from hiring to onboarding and support. For example, when you are ready to fill a job, be sure you have assessed the duties and responsibilities for the position and written a clear description of duties and qualifications, focusing on the accomplishment of duties rather than on how tasks are done. Quite often, employers think of basic job qualifications as tasks such as lifting a certain amount of weight or driving to meetings. Of course, these aren’t the functions of the job. Next, make sure that hiring tools, from forms to applications are accessible and usable by people with disabilities. You will also want to ensure the accessibility of internal systems like timesheets and other business applications as well as documents produced and used by your employees. And, as I said before, do not forget to plan for making employee training accessible. Be sure to have someone check the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and any state codes regarding physical access, braille/large print signage and other facility issues. Finally, I recommend that you build disability awareness training into your plan for all employees. This will help your employees understand disability and address misconceptions and biases. Congratulations! Up to this point, your planning stakeholders tell you everything is going well so far.  Now what can go wrong? Technology! You need to address technology accessibility.  One of the biggest mistakes in hiring people with disabilities is not understanding that they may need accessible technology to be successful. Start by identifying any assistive technology that may be needed. These are disability specific software and hardware solutions and often the person with a disability will know about solutions that work well for him/her. Test the assistive technology with “ALL” applications using common work flows. Assess the applications to ensure all functions can be completed. Add any needed assistive technology to the technology configuration management process. Note: This does not replace auditing the applications for accessibility based on the applicable standards. What can you do if the assistive technology doesn’t play nice with your business applications? This is not uncommon so planning and preparing a solution is very important. The best case is to remediate the accessibility issues in the documents and applications you own or develop in house. Most likely, your plan will also involve an effort to persuade the application owner to address accessibility. Remember, you’re the customer so it’s OK for you to ask the developer of software you use to make it accessible. Finally, as a last resort you may need to have a process in place to adapt the assistive technology to work with your software and systems. Training! We’ve already mentioned it a couple of times. You need to ensure your training and support for the employee is fully accessible. We often find this is a missed step.  A disabled employee shows up for the first day of work and the orientation and training you’ve prepared is not accessible. Planning and preparation will save you from lost productivity and loss of employee morale. Own the problem and find a solution. You may need to adjust a web interface, or ensure that documents are accessible. Bottom line Make sure you have a plan. Start now. Don’t wait until you have your first disabled employee.  Have everything prepared when the employee shows up the first day.  The last thing you want is to have a new employee waiting for you to get things figured out. Remember: people with disabilities want to be like everyone else and to be productive at work just like their peers.  Pointer Events advance to W3C Recommendation  Posted on Tuesday, 24 February 2015 by Patrick H. Lauke  Category: Standards   As a member of the Pointer Events Working Group, I am delighted to see that today Pointer Events advanced to an official W3C Recommendation. Having spent the last few years actively researching and documenting the often incongruous behaviour (and idiosyncratic “magic” heuristics) of Touch Events implementations across various platforms (see my JavaScript touch/pointer events research notes post), I’ve experienced first-hand the contortions that developers have to go through in order to create websites and applications that want to support both mouse and touch interactions. Although admittedly Pointer Events are still fairly low-level, compared to more abstract (and input-agnostic) models such as IndieUI: Events, they are a pragmatic step towards allowing developers to more easily create code that adapts to the variety of old and new devices and input modalities. I see Pointer Events clearly aligned with other technologies, such as CSS Media Queries, in service of a modern “responsive web design” approach. I strongly believe (and community feedback received by the Working Group overwhelmingly seems to support this belief) that Pointer Events provide developers with the best of both worlds: a simple, unified, and most importantly well documented model to handle user interactions in an input-agnostic way (for situations in which a developer does not particularly care which type of input triggered a particular action), while also allowing for input-specific optimisations (for instance, providing users with a different, more appropriate interface depending on whether they’re using a mouse, touchscreen or stylus). The fact that many JavaScript utility libraries and frameworks internally make use of a very similar custom event model for handling touch and mouse interactions is, in my mind, further proof that the approach taken by Pointer Events is conceptually on the right track. Of course, today’s announcement is marred by is the fact that the Google Chrome team – despite their excellent collaboration and contributions to the specification – have chosen not to implement Pointer Events, due in large part to the fact that Apple – who unfortunately did not engage in this standardisation process – have quite unequivocally stated that they will not include Pointer Events in Safari (for technical, and some cynics might argue, political reasons). Instead, a parallel effort is now under way to extend Touch Events – the model originally invented by Apple – under the aegis of the Touch Events Community Group (and you can follow the ongoing work on the Touch Events errata on GitHub). In the meantime, for developers who do wish to take advantage of Pointer Events, one possible solution is to use Polyfills, such as the excellent PEP (originally created by Google, now maintained by the jQuery Foundation). From an accessibility standpoint, my only disappointments with the Pointer Events specification is the fact that, despite trying to provide a holistic event handling model for all types of pointing devices, it does not cover keyboards and keyboard-like interfaces (even though, I would argue, these types of interfaces still represent a means by which users can “point” at elements – see some of the discussions in this mailing list thread and some data points from my research into “Faked” event coordinates). This means that developers will still need to “double up” some of their event handling to cover both keyboards and the abstracted “pointer” devices. However, as a compromise, I’m pleased that I at least managed to sneak an explict note about keyboard accessibility in the introduction to the spec – something that I am hoping to also feed into the work on the Touch Events errata.

Lauke: Getting Touchy: An introduction to touch and pointer events (workshop slides)   Accessibility for Business and Pleasure  Posted on Tuesday, 5 January 2016 by Sarah Horton  Category: Strategy   By Sarah Horton and David Sloan Note: This is the manuscript version of the article that appeared in the January/February 2016 issue of ACM Interactions, posted here with permission. With digital accessibility, standards compliance is a fleeting illusion, like a rainbow. We are accessibility consultants who engage with clients from all sectors, many of whom are focused on compliance audits and remediation of accessibility issues. We recognize the value of evaluation and repair of digital resources. We also know that an accessibility strategy defined by chasing compliance with technical standards is shortsighted and will likely end in failure. Standards compliance is rare, whether with Section 508, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or with any other standard. Thorough evaluation of a website containing hundreds or thousands of pages is practically impossible. Many standards require subjective evaluation—are a thousand words really needed to describe a picture? Even when there is some semblance of compliance, it’s at a fixed moment in time. What happens when a visitor uploads an image and does not provide a text alternative? With one unconsidered action, the theoretical “accessibility” toggle can switch from on to off in an instant.  Can we rethink accessibility in more effective and sustainable terms—ones that generate a positive return on investment for providers and a pleasurable user experience for everyone? The Return on Investment for Accessibility In the Wu-Tang Clan song “C.R.E.A.M.,” Method Man reminds us how money defines success: “Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M. / Get the money; dollar, dollar bill, y’all.” There’s no denying that organizations must make resource commitments largely based on money. Sometimes these resource decisions are about becoming more profitable, but often the driver is less about profit and more about delivering on promises—paying employees, providing good health coverage, covering overhead. The practice of making resource decisions based on potential return on investment (ROI) applies particularly to activities with an uncertain outcome. At minimum, a business case for a new activity will show how financial gains will at least cover the costs of engagement. A strong business case will show an ROI that both covers costs and brings in profit. Making a case for accessibility can take many forms that are not focused on the bottom line: protecting human and civil rights, meeting legal obligations, or creating better designs for everyone. However, these discussions usually come around to the same question: How many people are affected and how much revenue can be gained? No matter how the numbers line up, a business case for accessibility based on how many and how much cannot add up to something that offsets the perceived costs—not enough people are affected and the costs of accessibility are not readily quantifiable. Lainey Feingold, a lawyer specializing in the field of disability rights law applied to technology, explains how in the mid-1990s a Bank of America executive stood up at a national convention and shifted the conversation, saying, “We have to stop counting—this is a civil rights issue.” How do we reconcile the need to stay solvent and make a profit with the costs of accessibility? One method is to focus instead on delivering quality experiences. Forbes’ Steve Denning quotes Apple’s Tim Cook, saying, “When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind, I don’t consider the bloody ROI.” Apple is profitable and can afford to ignore ROI in some areas. The article goes on to explain that Apple has many activities that “make little or no money” but are part of a larger business strategy of building a base of happy customers. “Apple makes a lot of money not only because it has a very efficient supply chain but also because it has created a customer ecosystem that, as a whole, delights customers and makes them want to stay as an Apple customer” [1]. While we all may aspire to be customer-focused, with delight as a success indicator, most of us can’t afford to invest resources without considering ROI. There is a return on investment for accessibility, but it’s not in the profits—it’s in the margins. It’s in the money not spent, or spent more wisely. Organizations that treat accessibility as a compliance activity wind up throwing resources at it ad hoc, for example:  monitoring software to flag technology issues rather than developer training for how to write accessible code add-on overlays that purport to resolve issues rather than user research to learn how to design accessible interfaces one-off express turnaround captioning services rather than program development to establish processes and negotiate favorable terms with a vendor time and effort recruiting a “specialist” who has responsibility for accessibility rather than a coordinated effort to up-skill staff and share responsibility across teams.  Redirecting accessibility resources toward smart and lasting investments saves money, and for the long term. Accessibility can also generate returns that come from designing in the “margins” of use cases. Focusing design research on the needs and preferences of people with disabilities can drive discovery and innovation. In Change by Design, Tim Brown cautions against too narrow a view: “By concentrating solely on the bulge at the center of the bell curve we are more likely to confirm what we already know than learn something new and surprising.” With accessibility, insights gained by addressing “the exaggerated concerns of people at the margins” can result in products that are more delightful for everyone [2]. Apple’s VoiceOver and Siri are examples—screen reader and speech recognition software that make mobile devices easy to use for people who can’t see, and help people get from here to there, listen to and send emails and text messages, or switch songs while driving. Accessibility is something we must address in order to meet obligations. Accessibility done right is a way to cut costs, build capacity, and establish partnerships. Accessibility as a driver for innovation is an opportunity to learn what’s needed to design delightful products.  Accessibility strategy and activity fit neatly on a maturity continuum. Progress along the continuum means moving away from accessibility as a retroactive, responsive activity of doing “just enough to comply” toward one where accessibility is part of culture and practice. The continuum begins with identifying and endeavoring to address existing barriers. The second phase prioritizes the repair of issues based on real-world impact on target user groups’ ability to complete tasks, rather than technical conformance levels. However, both these phases focus on retrofitting existing products. Moving along the continuum we inject accessibility activities into the development process, addressing issues before they are embedded into design and code. Accessibility activities are still responsive, looking at designs and course-correcting to avoid creating barriers. In its most mature form, accessibility is integrated into all aspects of organizational planning and thinking, where it helps to frame a problem space, identify opportunities, and influence the design of solutions. A mature approach to accessibility has broad benefits. As Feingold notes, commitment to accessibility helps anticipate and deal with the unknown future: “Companies have to bake accessibility in because who knows what they’re going to be developing tomorrow?” Moving accessibility from a peripheral activity to one as central to practice as safety, ethics, and good grammar requires shared responsibility and a commitment to accommodating user diversity across all areas of organizational activity. User experience must be valued as a critical business strategy, and accessibility prioritized as a quality attribute. With a mature accessibility program in place, organizations can reap the benefits of improved business processes and better products, and enjoy the resulting return on investment. Progress Toward Accessibility Maturity Many organizations embark on strategic accessibility activities in response to some form of complaint. It’s not that organizations have expressly ignored the concerns of people with disabilities. In most cases, the complaint comes because they have not paid enough attention, or because other issues took priority. But complaints can galvanize organizations to make fundamental changes in how they provide digital resources, beyond addressing the specific product at issue and then closing the accessibility project. Feingold describes how Bank of America first engaged in addressing accessibility and technology issues in the mid-1990s, when they received complaints about the inaccessibility of their ATMs to blind customers. Bank of America worked to address issues specifically related to ATM accessibility, but their focus soon had to extend beyond ATMs, as banking activities moved to the Web: What makes it work? When companies get to know the user at the start. That’s really the key. What makes it work less well? When the process is in the hands of the lawyers only. There’s good agreement, we get improved accessibility, but it doesn’t always stick in the same way. An accessibility program fueled by addressing a complaint can only be sustained a limited time before it runs out of steam. A mature program grounded on a commitment to ensure people with disabilities can participate helps embed accessibility as a core value and lasting concern. In our work, we help organizations move from a reactive, compliance-driven approach of audit-and-repair to one that positions accessibility as a strategic long-term activity. Here we share case studies from three organizations, each diverse in its business activity and distinct in its position and progress in the journey. These stories illustrate approaches that can lead to success, and where organizational challenges can lead to a need to a change in approach. Healthwise: Sharing responsibility for accessibility in product development For Healthwise, a nonprofit provider of health information and products, the push to take a strategic approach to accessibility came from clients. Healthwise had been considering accessibility but did not have a formal program in place. Organizations that use their products, such as health systems and other healthcare providers, have obligations in meeting the needs of all patients, and those customers taking active interest in the technical accessibility of Healthwise products to their patients provided the push Healthwise needed to prioritize a more structured approach. Healthwise’s mission is to help people make better health decisions. To be successful they must design products that speak to a diverse audience. Healthwise’s vice president of user experience, Becky Reed, observes that within healthcare in general, “accessibility is tied to a broader health compliance sphere that cares about usability and engagement and a whole myriad of other things.” Even with lots of commitment to meeting user needs, accessibility was seen primarily as an engineering concern—something addressed under the hood, in code. The UX team knew accessibility was important but wasn’t well versed in how to integrate it into visual and interaction design. The content team was expert at creating health resources using plain language but didn’t have insights into how content affected the experience of people with disabilities. The engineering team felt on the hook, implementing designs that were sometimes difficult to make accessible, and viewed coding for accessibility as somewhat mysterious. In the end, Healthwise found success in getting people in every team passionate about accessibility, supporting interested staff in what they needed to build their expertise and their organizational advocacy. This was a shift from having a single strong voice, which might have been more of a blocker than a benefit, as Reed notes: “We needed to move away from the mindset of, ‘We need to talk about this with Becky.’ ” Within six months of this new approach, team-level accountability and responsibility emerged, alongside a sense of pride and ownership among team members in work that was important to them. As it increased focus on accessibility, Healthwise found success in dealing with accessibility problems as technical debt: “We can either continue to create technical debt, or we can just tackle this now.” One developer analyzed audits that were done on the software and found that 98 percent of all the changes made to repair accessibility issues were about implementing semantic coding practices that are not unique to accessibility. The ROI found in this technical analysis got the attention of the chief technology officer, who saw the data and laid out a more efficient path. The result was a partnership between UX and engineering teams to share energy and budget dollars. All team leadership set expectations with staff and supported their teams in the training, time, and priority they needed. Team leadership also talked about the strategic approach to accessibility with passion because they were just as invested in it as the historical champions were. It also resulted in an organizational mandate that UX won’t hand anything to engineering that could not be made accessible, and that accessibility is a much larger part of the product release process. With engineering, QA, UX, and content teams engaging meaningfully with accessibility, product management created a new product manager position focused on accessibility. Reed recalls how it came about: It wasn’t “Becky wants another resource.” It was, “Seventeen people are talking about this. This is an organizational commitment.” Once we had enough folks in the organization seeing accessibility as an imperative in healthcare, that was where the switch really flipped for product management. They said, “Whoa, we’re going to take one of our FTEs and make it more about accessibility.” Pearson: Building accessibility knowledge and skills across the board Pearson PLC is a large multinational company with many products and services, from brick-and-mortar schools to standardized tests to digital books to learning management systems. With such a diverse and global portfolio, Pearson is accustomed to receiving and responding to complaints of many different flavors. The one that kicked off their strategic accessibility program was when they were called out by the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), who in their 2012 Resolutions “condemned and deplored” Pearson for their inattention to the needs of people who are blind [3]. Pearson understandably felt it needed to respond positively. The company recognized that the solution was not to quickly apply Band-Aids to staunch the bleeding until the negative attention has passed. “For me there was a realization that it’s going to be impossible for people to function in life without being able to manage digital resources,” says Rick Ferrie, Pearson’s director of global policy. Pearson initially made good progress addressing the concerns raised by the NFB, but when the heat eased up, attention to accessibility began to wane. When it came time to define the work order for the next release of one product, the product team asked whether they needed to include accessibility in the new release. “As long as someone still thinks it’s something they have to do as opposed to something they want to do, then we haven’t moved the needle where it needs to go,” says Ferrie. Ferrie’s greatest challenge has been engaging the design and development teams. “When your chief engineer making a product says, ‘We don’t want to do this,’ that’s a hard thing to get past. We have to somehow convince the development community that this isn’t going to make bad products, that it isn’t hard, and that it isn’t some kludge add-on thing.” So far Pearson’s efforts have been focused on developing individual accessibility specialists at a junior level, but there is ambition to ensure accountability for accessibility moves up the organization chart. Ferrie knows that long term, responsibility must be owned by managers and shared by everyone on the team: “Having lots of accessibility worker bees is not the same as having the lead architect on a product owning accessibility and manifesting it in designs.” Knowledge building at Pearson has been a combination of building awareness among leaders and developing skills on the ground. These efforts have been successful at building accessibility specialists, but the company knows a strong infusion of high-level expertise is needed: We want to find big-time developers, designers, academic technologists, that get it and embed them into core platform teams, as peers of the mainstream architects and engineers. We can’t train 10,000 developers in enough time to get where we need to be. University of Colorado at Boulder: Establishing an accessibility program For the University of Colorado at Boulder, the trigger for rethinking accessibility was a formal investigation by the Department of Justice, representing several students with vision impairments who submitted a complaint that their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) had been violated by the university. CU-Boulder has a strong program supporting students with disabilities, but the relationship between accommodating students with disabilities and providing an accessible digital environment—one composed mainly of third-party tools—had not been solidified [4]. Accessibility barriers were present in a range of tools that students were expected to use. CU-Boulder’s response has been grounded in a commitment to address the issues at the foundational layer. “The way we are building our digital accessibility program is definitely for the long haul as opposed to a short sprint,” says Marin Stanek, director of academic and campus technology communications and support. Historically, CU-Boulder has followed the model of accommodating students, staff, and visitors with disabilities through the Student Disability Services (SDS) and Human Resources’ Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO), with the Office of Information Technology (OIT) playing a supporting role, helping SDS or OEO where needed with assistance with accommodations. With the digital accessibility program, OIT made accessibility among its “chief” concerns by establishing a new role: chief digital accessibility officer. Like security and privacy, CU-Boulder recognizes that everyone at the university has a role to play in ensuring an accessible IT environment. Including accessibility in the larger context provides the opportunity to layer accessibility on top of prior experience and existing frameworks. For CU-Boulder, a public university with a large and complex digital estate, the challenge is one of scope and control. “We have hundreds of IT services; we have over 1,000 different websites,” says chief security officer/chief digital accessibility officer Dan Jones. For success, many individuals and organizations must see the value of accessibility and engage with it in their work. Faculty must understand what’s needed to produce accessible course materials, and make the effort to follow best practices. “I think at the end of the day the concerns that people will have will be, what are you requiring for websites, or why are you telling me to have language in the syllabus?” says Jones. To reduce the learning curve, training is focused on giving people the skills to apply relevant accessibility knowledge in the context of doing their job. “Rather than saying, you must have accessibility training, we talk about role-based training. You are a faculty member; here are the things you need to know as part of being a faculty member.” In the course of writing this article, the Department of Justice closed their inquiry with CU-Boulder. And while they are relieved, Jones relates, “The best part is that it really reflects on all of the hard work the project team has been doing and reinforces the direction we are taking.” In particular, it solidifies the connections and partnerships established in the course of responding to the inquiry. The CU-Boulder team is on a journey, and they know their work isn’t done. But they’re building an accessibility program that allows them to strategically deal with legacy accessibility issues while minimizing the chances of barriers emerging as they grow and develop their digital estate. Pleasure in the Margins Anyone involved with book design understands that margins are where the magic happens. In his Medium article “Let’s Talk About the Margins,” Craig Mod walks us through a love story, with protagonists from a dictionary publisher who unite around close attention to details that normally go unnoticed—the quality of paper that makes it adhere to fingers at just the right amount to make turning pages effortless, even sensual [5]. Examining this and other subtle pleasures, he says, “Thoughtful decisions concerned with details marginal or marginalized conspire to affect greatness.” Accessibility provides us with an opportunity to affect greatness in design. By approaching accessibility as a creative challenge, we can see clearly the nuances that make or break user experience—and avoid the issues that over time make interaction so difficult, so inefficient, and so physically tiring as to be practically impossible for someone with a disability. Usability studies and user research with people with disabilities can bring into sharp focus issues that everyone faces. In a recent usability study, we evaluated a Web application with people with a range of disabilities, including no vision, low vision, and limited dexterity. The uncertainty when activating a button that does not provide visual or audible feedback is felt keenly by users with limited dexterity, who have difficulty clicking or tapping a button. The difficulty and strain of tracking along the row of a bus timetable to find the right departure time are magnified when using zoom. Inconsistency in design patterns is even more disorienting when navigating a site by ear—is this supplementary information a tooltip, a dialog, or a new page, and how do I resume where I left off? Difficulty interpreting interaction feedback, data tables, and inconsistent design are familiar issues for all of us. The recently published “Manifesto for Accessible User Experience” [6] includes a statement from our colleague Léonie Watson. She powerfully described accessibility as “a creative challenge, not a challenge to creativity.” We have no doubt there is a business case for accessibility that involves both cost savings that arise from smart resource allocation as well as newfound general innovations for the broader market. Better to invest in making desirable products than cleaning up a mess. What really gets our juices flowing is the business case for designing pleasure that can be experienced by everyone. With accessibility as an attribute, user experience moves from “nice to have” to “blocker” due to the imperatives of legal obligations and the clarity that comes from focusing on the margins. Accessibility spotlights essential attributes of quality and focuses attention on what matters: whether or not people can participate. Ferrie says, “If I could call it something other than accessibility I would. I would call it design that works for everyone, or good design.” We are sympathetic to the desire to move away from talking about accessibility, with its attendant misperceptions of limited return on investment and crushing influence on innovative and appealing design. But we’re also mindful of our responsibility to people with disabilities, to the human rights issue that underpins our work, and our creative powers to reduce or remove barriers to social interaction, not construct new ones. When we talk about the benefits of accessibility, we must make sure we don’t inadvertently downplay the focus on people with disabilities. At the same time, we can’t help but spill over with enthusiasm for exploring the opportunities we collectively stand to gain by careful attention to people who are not in the mainstream. While we acknowledge the pragmatism of Method Man, we join our voices with Craig Mod’s Paper Man in saying, “WE WILL TRY HARDER.” Creativity and innovation arise from understanding the nuances that are experienced keenly in the margins. There lie the insights that will lead us to discover more pleasurable experiences for everyone.

Sounding out the web: accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing people [Part 2]  Posted on Monday, 20 March 2017 by David Swallow  Category: UX   In my previous post, I spoke with Ruth MacMullen, an academic librarian and copyright specialist from York, about her experience of being deaf and how it affects how she uses the web. In this next post in the series, Ruth shares some of the things that make life easier for her on the web, and we offer some practical tips on how you can improve accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing people. Provide subtitles/captions “Subtitles, that’s the really obvious one”, remarks Ruth as we discuss the things that help her the most. In my previous post, she described the frustration of viewing a video posted on Facebook that lacked subtitles. Subtitles or captions are the words shown at the bottom of videos that explain what’s being said or what’s happening. The term “subtitles” typically refers only to spoken content, whereas “captions” also includes descriptions of non-speech sounds, such as music, applause and laughter. Outside of North America, the terms are often used interchangeably. So when Ruth refers to subtitles on videos, that’s what she’s talking about. This article by Tom Mitchell at JISC highlights the benefits of captions towards accessibility, and he describes how you can add them to videos on YouTube and Facebook. Check the accuracy of captions YouTube and Facebook (in the US) offer free automated video captioning—but since there aren’t any humans involved, the captions they produce can be wildly inaccurate. “I’ve seen ones where irrelevant and inappropriate words, including expletives, came up!” remarks Ruth. “I was quite surprised there was no protection or filtering to stop those. I’ve also seen one where ‘Nazi’ and the ‘S-word’ came up in relation to an information literacy video—all in one sentence!” Google provides clear instructions on how you can review and edit automated captions on YouTube. If you make use of automated captions, you need to take the time to edit them because automated captions are notoriously terrible to begin with. “It makes such a difference to a deaf person if a little bit of effort has been made to clean up subtitles”, explains Ruth. “You can see they are so much more accurate.” Make sure that captions are synchronised with the audio One advantage of using automated captioning is that the captions are automatically synchronised to the audio. Some video makers choose to generate their captions from an existing transcript. And if you do that, you need to make sure that each line appears on screen at about the same time that the audio is heard. “When you’re deaf, you want it to run in time” explains Ruth. She cites two examples of good practices: the Lynda.com training videos and the British Universities Film & Video Council’s BoB (Box of Broadcasts) service. “I sometimes notice a couple of seconds’ delay,” Ruth remarks, “but on the whole, it’s good.” Provide a summary of audio and video content In my previous post, Ruth explained how a brief summary of what a video is about can be just as important as captions or a transcript. A video’s summary may be as simple as a list of topics or songs that the video includes, which Ruth likens to “alternative text for someone with a hearing impairment”. Ruth recalls watching a concert on YouTube: “There’s a piano player playing Gershwin songs and I’ll think, ‘Which one do I want to listen to?’ I can’t skip through and listen to fragments, I need to know what’s in there before I make a choice to watch it. And I feel like I don’t have that choice if I don’t know what’s in it.” Make sure that audio doesn’t play automatically Deaf and hard of hearing people may have a hard time gauging how loud videos are, particularly when they play automatically and unexpectedly. “You see a video on your Facebook feed and there’s no sound”, explains Ruth. “If you click on it to make it big, the sound plays, but you don’t realise. Sometimes I have my hearing aid off and I feel like the video is blaring out sound.” Ruth describes how frustrating this can be when she doesn’t even know that the webpage includes an auto-playing video: “Sometimes you’re browsing the web and you get video adverts that play sound and you don’t realise. That’s caused a couple of embarrassing situations in the office.” So try to avoid playing audio automatically, but if it’s unavoidable, make sure that users have an easy way to turn it off. Structure your content In my previous post, Ruth emphasised the importance of structured content, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. “I rely so much on visual information”, she explains. “The more clearly it is structured and the more clear what it is, the better.” Ruth is currently undertaking a law degree through distance learning, which involves using a virtual learning environment. “They’re really good about their use of headings; they’re very descriptive. If they weren’t, I’d feel very lost because I completely rely on reading for understanding.” Using semantic HTML helps websites remain flexible and extensible. It makes the content reusable and conveys more meaning to assistive technologies. As Ruth points out, “This is good practice generally, but for people who are completely reliant on visual information, even more important.” Keep your content flexible Underscoring each of these suggestions is an emphasis on clear communication and flexibility of content. Mobile technology has proven particularly useful to Ruth in this respect. “I think if you speak to any person with a disability, they will tell you that an iPhone or an Apple Watch is a game changer.” Ruth shares a blog post by Molly Watt, an inclusive technology advocate who is deaf-blind. Molly’s post describes her experience of using an Apple Watch and the way that its haptic feedback has proven particularly useful for navigating. The benefit that Ruth sees in such technology is being able to curate information in a way that suits her. “I can’t hear a radio very well if it’s in a room, but if I plug in my special Bluetooth headphones to my iPhone, I can listen to a radio programme. For me, it’s a bit of a lifesaver in terms of being able to get information, get content, and modify it in a way that works for me.” Content that’s flexible enough to be delivered by captions, indexed by transcripts, enlarged by screen magnifiers, and rendered by screen readers is a key principle of web accessibility. And while many of the tips in this post are useful for deaf and hard of hearing people, they ultimately benefit everyone.

The promise of personalised interfaces  Posted on Wednesday, 13 September 2017 by Matthew Atkinson  Category: DevelopmentCategory: UX   The last post in this series ends by saying that the world of academic research has a lot to offer in terms of innovative approaches to adaptation that can improve accessibility for people with various impairments—either due to disability or situation—and even multiple impairments at the same time. But how can conflicting requirements for very large fonts and touch-target areas on a small-screen device be realised? How can the application fit into these seemingly irreconcilable constraints? The SUPPLE project lead by Krzysztof Gajos is a prime example, and has produced algorithms that can automatically generate user interfaces from more abstract specifications (i.e. the types of data presented to the user, or needs from the user). For example, if a numerical input is required, this might be expressed using a textbox in a traditional desktop app, or a spinner control with a sensible default value on a mobile where keyboard entry is more time-consuming. Buttons on mobile may be larger, with less spacing between them, to make the touch targets larger. But, there is much more to it than this: because the UI/content is specified in the abstract, its structure can be adapted where necessary. If all of the controls in a settings pane won’t fit onto the small screen of a mobile phone, then they can be “folded” into a tab panel, with related controls on separate tab panels, and with the most commonly-accessed controls on the first panel. Further: the font size (and other graphical properties) of the controls can be adjusted too. If making the font size larger means some controls won’t fit on the screen, scrolling or the aforementioned folding (or some combination of the two, depending on which would be easiest for this individual user to navigate) can be used to re-arrange them. This allows content and interfaces to adapt to the user, regardless of the constraints imposed upon them by situational barriers (e.g. they’re using a phone rather than a full computer) or impairments (e.g. vision or motor difficulties).  It’s also important to note that people’s preferences are taken into consideration, too—if you prefer tab panels to scrolling, or sliders to entering numbers, then those controls will be used when possible.  If such an approach were adopted for apps and web content, we could have just the adaptations we need, without the compromises of assistive technologies that mimic physical interventions such as magnifiers. An example decision tree showing different adaptations that could be applied to a user interface in combination, to achieve radically different results. The adaptations include: using visible text, or spoken words; folding content with tabs; shortening/summarising content so it takes less space (and time to browse) and leaving the content as-is. Because of the abstract way in which interfaces are specified, one also wonders if they could be adapted for voice/conversational interaction, too—it would not take much additional effort to support such platforms… How do we get there? First of all, it would be great if platform developers and device manufacturers integrated novel approaches such as these into their systems.  More than this, though, some common means to describe users’ needs is also required, that will work ubiquitously.  Projects such as the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) aim to achieve this by having a standard set of user preferences that live in the cloud and can be served up to devices from ATMs to computers and TVs.  When such devices adopt techniques, such as those above, to help them adapt, then services such as GPII could help deliver the information about people, their preferences and capabilities, that would support that adaptation. There’s one final barrier that has only been touched upon above, and that is the lack of awareness people have of their own accessibility needs and the support that is already (or could be, as above) on offer to support them.  Many don’t identify with the term “accessibility” at all.  Also, even if they had a set of preferences established, when starting to use a totally new device for the first time, those preferences may not translate fully to the new environment (multi-touch gestures aren’t usually applied to an ATM, and keyboards are not usually attached to phones).  Therefore, it seems natural to work out what adaptations a user needs based on their capabilities as a human—their visual acuity, various measures of dexterity and so on.  If we could get even a rough idea of these factors, then devices/environments can be set up for someone in an accessible manner, before they have even used them. Summary Current assistive technologies have been and remain instrumental in assuring our independence.  However, we can make such technologies more relevant to the mainstream by capitalising upon current trends, and by learning from novel techniques developed by research projects. We will be visiting some more novel and interesting assistive technologies in forthcoming posts.  One Reason Why Section 508 Isn’t Working  Posted on Wednesday, 21 November 2007 by Mike Paciello  Category: News   An area of accessibility that I have been deeply involved in for the past 18 months is the TEITAC (Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory Committee). By the way, it’s pronounced “Tie Tack” not “Tea Tack”. TEITAC consists of 42 member organizations including government, industry, consumer and international (EU, Canada, Japan, and Australia) representatives. In short, the charter of this committee is to revise the US Federal Section 508Â Â Â and Section 255Â laws.Â  Section 508 involves information technology and Section 255 involves telecommunications. With technology convergence increasingly becoming the norm, is it any wonder why this committee was asked to revise both standards…at the same time??? Interestingly while we were conducting TEITAC meetings at NSF headquarters in Washington, DC last week, one ofÂ our members caught wind of an interesting article that appeared in Federal Computer Week (FCW) magazine. The articleÂ cited a recent memo distributed by the Office of Management and BudgetÂ toÂ federal agencey Chief Acquistion OfficersÂ and Chief Information Officers reminding them of their responsibility to upholdÂ the procurement standardsÂ mandated byÂ Section 508. According to the memo,Â “…a recent assessment by GSA showed that only 3% of theÂ solicitations that included E&IT, properlyÂ included the Section 508 standards.”Â  The articleÂ underscoresÂ one of the key weaknesses in Section 508 today: the lack of self-regulation and commitment to Section 508 by federal agencies. Since Section 508 was released in June 2001, the primary enforcement focus has been on industry’s role and responsibility. The pervasive thinking was that compliance could beÂ betterÂ achievedÂ by ensuring that industry designed, developed, and delivered accessible electronic and information technology for agency procurement. And there seems to be merit to this way of thinking. But the OMB memo cuts to the heart of the matter. IfÂ federal contractingÂ and procurement officersÂ do not include the 508 requirements as part of their procurement request documentation, industry has no motivation to invest money and resources required to enhance their products for accessibility. At TPG, we’ve experienced this issue first hand. Time after time we hear clients and potential clients tell us that the majority of agencies do not document Section 508 compliance requirementsÂ in their procurement. As a result, industry has no motivation to comply. Make no mistake about it, federal government contracts are big business. Several of our clients are involved in multi-billion dollar federal IT initiatives. If agencies are not enforcing 508, federal employees and citizens suffer the consequences. To quote the OMB memo: “When properly implemented, Section 508 improves the accessibility of government information and data and ensures government E&IT is accessible to FederalÂ employees and citizens with disabilities. Building an accessible infrastructure creates an environment for hiring persons with disabilities.” Perhaps no one stated it better than Abraham Lincoln during his Gettysburg address when he said, “government of the people, by the people, for the people…”. This cuts to the heart of the matter. Section 508 isn’t about technology, it’s about people.  Are Delay Tactics Preventing Passage of New Section 508 Disability Law?  Posted on Wednesday, 11 January 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Brian Landrigan – Director of Sales & Marketing at The Paciello Group made the following representation to the Public Hearing on the Draft Update of ICT Requirements, January 11 2012. Request for timely implementation of the new standards Chairperson Melick, honorable members of the United States Access Board, good morning.  My name is Brian Landrigan and I am the director of sales and marketing for The Paciello Group, a small consulting firm.   Our headquarters are in Nashua, NH, and we are solely dedicated to providing consulting services in the areas of application accessibility for software development companies and website accessibility for companies needing to create accessible web properties.   I appreciate and thank the board for this opportunity today to provide public comment on the second Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that includes a revised draft of updated accessibility requirements for information and communication technology covered by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and Section 255 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Negative impact of out of date standards First, I would like to commend the Access Board and the Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory Committee for their diligence in developing and bringing to public the updated requirements.  In our business, we are acutely aware of how the older standards lacked acknowledgement of the vast changes in information technology that has occurred over the past decade.   My peers and I at The Paciello Group applaud your efforts to make the internet and information technology in general more accessible for the most disengaged segment of our population – people with disabilities.   The simple act of creating new standards and opening the dialogue within industry is sparking a fervent interest in many of our clients that did not exist prior to this.   We are experiencing first-hand a new energy and enthusiasm for providing a more open technology world.  The original announcement from TEITAC in April, 2008, was warmly welcomed by our business, our clients and our competitors.   We see that as a watershed date for the accessibility business. Slow progress affecting business uptake Unfortunately, nearly 4 years have passed since that announcement.  While we all understand that sometimes government moves at a slower pace than commercial businesses, the fact that the proposals of TEITAC have not yet been implemented is disappointing.    Some of our clients are openly questioning now whether they needed to spend the funds necessary to implement the changes we and TEITAC recommended.  To us, there are three points to be made regarding this:  The delay in implementing the Section 508/255 ICT recommendations is having an adverse effect on our business and the business of consulting companies such as ours who have invested in training, development, tools and other resources to become expert at accessibility. We are not looking for business justifications for accessibility…things like cost of ownership models or return on investment.   It is our responsibility, selling accessibility consulting services, to create that information for our clients.   We need you to focus on the guidelines. Further delays are discouraging and deterring many companies and people who are accessibility proponents.   These are the people you are failing to support by not implementing the new guidelines.  Delay in implementation negatively impacts all stakeholders I would like to take a few moments to expand on these points.   First, let me discuss the adverse effect on our business.  I recognize this is somewhat self-serving.  However, our entire business is accessibility consulting, built on the belief that companies doing business with the federal government would need services such as we offer because federal agencies would insist on conformance to the new Section 508 standards.  We perceived a knowledge gap between the existing guidelines and the new guidelines and moved quickly to fill that gap and we have been successful.  We continue engaging prospects and clients eager to learn how to comply with the federal procurement mandate and how to create a more accessible technological environment for their customers.  However, with the delay in adoption for the new standards, we have clients who are second-guessing their decision to implement the changes to their development and testing departments based on our recommendations.   Further, we are now seeing clients postpone adoption of the recommendations, literally waiting to see if the adoption of the new Section 508 guidelines will be further delayed or even canceled.   Please act swiftly to counter this perception. Secondly, the business justification for adoption of the new Section 508 standards.  We are concerned that the lag time in adopting the new standards is related to getting them “perfect”.    There are numerous comments and concerns regarding cost of implementation of the new guidelines and whether this places an undue fiscal burden upon agencies and businesses.   This delaying tactic is frequently employed by special interest groups to make us question whether a practical application of something new is reasonable.  This has occurred in the past in discussions for equal rights for minorities, women and other disenfranchised groups.    Our point is that the implementation cost should be an area that the free market, composed of experts in accessibility and our clients is clearly capable of creating a value proposition demonstrating any cost is outweighed by additional benefits.  We can demonstrate that today and this should not be a gating factor in the new Section 508 moving forward. Thirdly, you are exhausting well-minded people who want to embrace accessibility and universal usability by further delaying the implementation of the new guidelines.  In our work, we come in contact with product managers, developers, quality assurance professionals, procurement specialists, directors of accessibility, CEOs, COOs, CFOs, etc.  A number of them are excited and enthusiastic about putting their products and their companies on the front line of greater access and opportunity for people with disabilities.   They are doing it for a myriad of reasons; it is the “right” thing to do, it is the law, it enhances their business, it improves their marketability, it is a selling point.  Having people and agencies within their government who feel as they do provides them with a satisfaction that we are all “pulling together on the same end of the rope”, that we are sharing a common goal.  This is immeasurably helpful when they encounter others within their own company opposed to accessibility for financial or logistical reasons.  As many of you can empathize I am sure from your own experience, they are “fighting the good fight” and it is rewarding.    But when you are on the front lines, fighting the good fight for a common cause, it is imperative that you know you have the support of those “behind the lines”.  Without that support, the fight is empty and impossible.  Without the passage of the new Section 508 standards, you are telling those “front line” people that you are questioning your resolve….that you are hesitating to wholeheartedly support them.   This is not a good message. Please move these important standards forward Once again, I want to personally thank the members of the TEITAC committee for the enormous effort put forth to get us to this point.  I also want to thank the Access Board and its staff, as well as other federal agency volunteers for their diligent efforts.  This is significant progress of which you should all be justifiably proud.  The new Section 508 standards will provide a dramatic improvement in the lives of people with disabilities, particularly in respect to access to technology and information with respect to a more open government.  In that case, we all win.   Please re-energize yourselves and move this very important set of standards forward so everyone can enjoy the benefits.   Thank you for your time and consideration.  What’s ‘large text’ in WCAG 2.0 parlance?  Posted on Friday, 25 May 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTMLTag: WCAG   I put together an example page, mainly for my own use, providing some examples of what in WCAG 2.0 terms is considered large and small text. WCAG 2.0 provides the font measurements in terms of points, so I initially used the CSS pt unit to set the font size in the examples, but have changed it to em’s after discussion with @goetsu. large text, bold text and the color contrast ratio The WCAG 2.0 criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) states: The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:(Level AA)  Large Text:  Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1; Incidental:  Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement. Logotypes:  Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement.   WCAG 2.0 Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3 [Contrast (Minimum)] defines large text: Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast. The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large Print). “18 point” and “bold” can both have different meanings in different fonts but, except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there are so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding fancy or thin fonts is included. Note 3: The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined size and the user’s display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 18.75px and 24px or 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display. The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings. Large, small and bold text reference page I wanted a reference page which illustrated small, small bold and large text as defined in WCAG 2.0 so I created one: Large text, bold text and the color contrast ratio NOTE: use of pt for screen media is not recommended Use of pt is not recommended for screen media only for print: The so-called absolute units (cm, mm, in, pt and pc) mean the same in CSS as everywhere else. A length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size (within the precision of the hardware and software). They are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. A big screen may be 60cm (24in), a small, portable screen is maybe only 8cm. And you don’t look at them from the same distance. A guide of limited utility Checking the example page on my iPhone I found that all the text is scaled down so what may be considered as large text on a PC screen is not on a phone or other device. Screenshot of the example page in the Safari browser on an iPhone. Contrast ratio rule of thumb The take away from this is that it is likely your pages will be viewed on a range of devices and screen sizes, so I suggest sticking with the 4.5:1 color ratio for all text.

Background The Internet of Things (IoT) represents the networking of “things” (whether physical or digital) within the existing internet infrastructure. For example, consider a single device that controls the heating, lighting and security of your home. Each of these physical components represents a “thing” in the network, so can be controlled from elsewhere on the internet. Until recently, however, ensuring smooth communication between diverse things without any form of human involvement was problematic. Early efforts were built on non-interoperable, occasionally proprietary, technologies and standards – thus making it extremely difficult (if not impossible) to combine things built by different vendors into a common network. To resolve this issue, the Web of Things Interest Group (WoT IG) was launched in 2015 with the aim of investigating – through use cases, requirements, and proposals from a variety of stakeholders (such as developer communities, industry, academia, and so on) – how communication between things could be standardized via existing and emerging non-proprietary standards. The overall goal, therefore, is to allow vendors to concentrate purely on building the specific features of their thing without having to worry about how it might fit into the overall WoT network. Think of this concept in terms of HTML – we use a common set of elements and attributes to mark up Web content, all of which are widely supported by different browsers, assistive technologies, and operating systems. From a technological point of view, developers do not need to (or shouldn’t need to) concern themselves as to whether their website will work as expected when using a certain browser or operating system – they only need to concentrate on developing their website or web application itself. The same idea is being applied to the physical world of things. The Web of Things Working Group (WoT WG) works closely with the WoT IG, and is specifically tasked with formally standardizing aspects of the IG that are deemed as mature enough to be considered potential W3C recommendations. One way this manifests itself is through semi-regular PlugFests, where both members and non-members come together to demonstrate proposals and prototype proofs-of-concept, all of which are based on the current draft specifications. Currently, there are four specific areas, or building blocks, that the WoT WG are tasked with standardizing, each of which is represented by its own Task Force (TF) within the IG/WG. These building blocks are described in more detail in the Web of Things (WoT) Architecture document: Thing Description (TD) The TD is a semantic, machine understandable, formal specification that forms the central building block of a WoT device, independent of the actual implementation. It represents a mechanism for describing – among other things – what the thing is (for example, a light), what its properties are (such as its status, e.g. on or off), what actions can be performed (switching the light on or off), and any associated events (a warning that the bulb needs replacing). Web Linking is also included within the description to describe the relationship between things and to allow the thing to be exposed to other things within the network. TDs are often described as the “index.html of the thing”, and this is quite an apt metaphor. If you think of a standard web page, it has a title, various landmarks (header section, footer, navigation), headings, lists, buttons, links and so on. Each of these is marked up using the appropriate HTML elements (title, header, ul, h1, button etc.). The TD essentially follows the same premise – it represents a way of “marking up” the networking capabilities of the thing. TDs are (currently) presented in JSON-LD format. A First Public Working Draft (FPWD) of the Thing Description specification was released in September 2017. Scripting API This building block is built on top of the TD to essentially allow for a common runtime environment (similar to a Web browser) to be built on the thing. This allows for things within a network to discover, consume, and expose data without having to delve into a particular device’s firmware to find this information. Again, having a standardized scripting API means that a vendor need not concern themselves with how content is rendered or exposed. Think of this issue in terms of websites – a developer need not build an entirely new, proprietary, browser for every Web product they produce. An FPWD of the Scripting API specification was also released in September 2017. Binding Templates As previously mentioned, many standards and protocols have already been developed that are applied already across different devices. While many of these standards and protocols contain common elements, they also may include important data that is provided in a peculiar, non-standard, format that does not easily fit into an existing TD. Binding Templates are intended to act as a “go-between” between these early standards and protocols, and the standardized TD, and are included as an extended vocabulary within the TD. The idea behind binding templates is to ensure that older and/or non-standardized products can be adapted to fit into the newer standardized network. For further information, refer to the Editors Draft of the Protocol Binding Templates specification. Security and Privacy From a lay person’s perspective, security and privacy is obviously a major concern when one thinks of the Internet of Things. This building block defines a set of security objectives for WoT devices based on common scenarios in different environments, such as the home, industry, and enterprise, as well as more general guidance on designing and deploying secure and privacy-respecting devices. Further information is provided in the Web of Things Security and Privacy WG note. Implications for accessibility In my previous blog post on accessibility and the WoT, I argued that the WoT opens up many benefits for accessibility, opening up doors to people who otherwise may not have been able to operate particular physical devices or even to independently take part in certain activities. It is important to note that the WoT IG and WG are both concerned primarily with machine-to-machine interaction, rather than specifically in terms of user interfaces. Yet, even at this low level, there are implications for accessibility. Even the smallest thing on the network may need some form of basic platform accessibility support to make information about the thing available to assistive technologies – for example, is this thing on or off? Is it overheating? Does the user need to change something (e.g. a bulb)? Consequently, we need to consider accessibility support is provided at the API level, ensuring that information that is eventually exposed to user interfaces and assistive technologies is done so in an accessible manner, and with little to no extra effort required by vendors at this level. For many years, and along with our colleagues and peers in the overall accessibility environment, we have vigorously fought to ensure standards are developed in such a way to ensure that features are accessibility supported. We have thus far been successful in ensuring that the Web world is accessibly supported – now it’s time to move into the physical world. My next steps are to produce detailed use cases which consider the potential opportunities and challenges for accessibility within the WoT. The following table provides a high level mapping between each of the above building blocks and the potential role of accessibility research.    Building block Accessibility considerations   Thing Description Are things described in a way that will eventually allow vendors to recognize and support agnostic interfaces (i.e. do not rely on the eventual user being able to see/hear/operate by voice or touch)? If not, is it possible to provide alternatives?   Scripting API Given that even the simplest of things will need to expose their state, how will an assistive technology user be able to get information about the current state in the absence of a runtime environment? Does the scripting API support the development of rudimentary runtime environments that allow external assistive technologies to query information about the thing?   Binding Templates If a non-standardized device includes helpful accessibility metadata that isn’t necessarily part of the TD specification, can this easily be included in the new TD? Is it possible to retroactively provide helpful accessibility metadata to non-standard or legacy devices that don’t include it as part of their description?   Security and Privacy Are privacy provisions provided in a way that a non-technical person, or even a person with a cognitive impairment, is likely to understand and act on? Can we make sure that devices don’t (explicitly or not) share accessibility information with third-party services? Within the healthcare sector, WoT devices have the potential to be life threatening if anything goes wrong; how do we consider this as part of the security of the device?    This is an exciting area which poses a lot of challenges and opportunities to include disabled people. If you have suggested use case for accessibility within the WoT I’d be interested to hear about it!  The Accessibility Tools Framework (ACTF)  Posted on Wednesday, 5 December 2007 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing   IBM announced today (4th, December, 2007)Â the contribution of its Accessibility Tools Framework (ACTF)Â to the Eclipse Foundation, an open source community focused on developing a universal platform of frameworks and exemplary tools. The ACTF project will be lead by Chieko Asakawa (IBM) and Mike Paciello (The Paciello Group). The Accessibility Tools Framework is a collection of tools and building blocks developed by IBM. By using the framework, developers can create accessibilitytools and applications easily and cost effectively, as they no longer need to spend time creating a tool or an application from scratch. With the reusable accessibility technology components of ACTF, and the standardized design and application programming interfaces the framework offers, developers can quickly and easily build various accessibility tools, such as an accessibility validation tool or a usability visualization tool. ACTF will allow developers to build and use various types of accessibility tools, such as those for accessibility compliance validation, usability visualization, and alternative accessible interfaces for persons with disabilities. These tools will be integrated into a single, comprehensive accessibility tooling environment as part of the Eclipse platform. Initially, ACTF will support content based on HTML, OpenDocument Format (ODF), Flash, Java application graphical user interfaces such as Java Swing and Eclipse SWT, and accessibility APIs such as Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) and IAccessible2 to provide unified accessibility to Web content and applications. Initial supporters of this initiative include:  Adobe Systems Incorporated (USA) BrailleNet (France) Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (Netherlands) International Webmasters Association/HTML Writers Guild (U.S.A.) Japan Braille Library (Japan) Mozilla foundation (U.S.A.) The Paciello Group (U.S.A.) Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) (U.K.) Technosite (ONCE Foundation) (Spain) University of Toronto (Canada) The Web Accessibility Tools Consortium  Further Reading:  Press Release:Â IBM Contributes Framework to Eclipse Foundation Accessibility Tools Framework (ACTF) IBM Accessibility Internet Browser for Multimedia IBM Adesigner IBM Contributes new Accessibility Tools Framework to Eclipse   Host an #ID24 event  Posted on Wednesday, 11 October 2017 by Léonie Watson  Category: Conferences   Inclusive Design 24 (#ID24) is a free online conference, but it doesn’t have to stop there.

UXPA UK World Usability Day 2017: Inclusion through User Experience  Posted on Monday, 27 November 2017 by David Swallow  Category: Conferences   To celebrate World Usability Day 2017, the UK Chapter of the User Experience Professionals’ Association (UXPA UK) hosted an event in Hammersmith, London entitled Inclusion through User Experience. The event was curated by Chris Bailey and Caroline Owen and, as TPG were one of the sponsors, Matthew Atkinson and I went along to check it out. Kicking off proceedings was Dr Simone Stumpf, from City University, who explained how the design process for the SCAMPI (Self-Care Advice, Monitoring, Planning and Intervention) toolkit involved a series of co-design workshops with people who have Parkinson’s and dementia. These co-creation workshops encouraged and enabled participants to share their experiences, and relate them to others’, in order to develop personas to be used in other stages of the project. The process was well received by the participants and resulted in high-quality personas being developed. Next up was Ian Craigton-Chambers, from the BAT (Bounce Alzheimers Therapy) Foundation who told us stories of the sometimes-intertwined histories of Alzheimer’s and table tennis, which can be used as a therapy. Research interest in the potential of table tennis has been piqued in recent years, through a number of studies, and the potential to help seems great. The BAT Foundation undertakes work with major sporting companies and other organisations to develop and deliver suitable tables for use in care homes and other settings. Some of their innovations include higher contrast between the playing surface and ball, and giving the tables sides. Ian and his very dedicated and energetic team also let us play with one of their latest tables, which they had brought with them. The third and final talk of the evening was by Emanuela Gorla, a member of the Digital Accessibility Team at Barclays. Framed by the concepts of “inspiring hearts”, “educating heads” and “enabling hands”, Emanuela outlined the steps that Barclays is taking to achieve their ambition of becoming the most accessible and inclusive organisation in the FTSE 100. These include the creation of a series of Diverse Personas to help people designing products and services understand the needs of customers with disabilities; the adoption of TPG’s Inclusive Design Principles; and the development of a suite of empathy tools (including an age simulation suit) that help to convey the experiences of disabled customers. Emanuela also demonstrated some of the outcomes of Barclays’ more inclusive approach, such as high-visibility debit cards and a revised PINsentry card reader, which have greatly improved the user experience of many customers, with and without disabilities. The event was a great success, with each speaker giving a fascinating insight into the inspiring work being undertaken to create accessible and inclusive experiences for all.

Inclusive Design 24 (#ID24) – Call for presentations  Posted on Monday, 27 February 2017 by Henny Swan  Category: Conferences   The next Inclusive Design 24 (#ID24) event will be held on 9 June 2017 (starting at 12 midnight GMT) – and our call for presentations is now open! Now in it’s fourth year, #ID24 is a free 24-hour online community event on accessibility, sponsored by The Paciello Group.  #ID24 has always covered a wide range of topics – from websites to web apps, native apps to open source, gaming to productivity and everything in between. This year the focus for #ID24 is levelling up – taking your skills and knowledge beyond the basics and beyond compliance. In previous years #ID24 has included speakers from around the world: Australia, New Zealand, America, Canada, France, Spain, Japan, the UK and beyond. This year we’d like to extend the event’s global family even more. But most importantly, #ID24 has always encouraged new voices. We want to continue this by welcoming new speakers to our community, enabling us all to keep levelling up our skills and knowledge through new ideas and perspectives. So whether you’re new to speaking or you have plenty of experience, we hope you’ll submit a talk. Visit Inclusive Design 24 to find out more. The call for presentations closes on 21 April 2017.  Mobile Accessibility Testing Guide for Android and iOS – free  Posted on Thursday, 2 November 2017 by Henny Swan  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Testing   The TPG Mobile Accessibility Testing for Android and iOS (PDF, 2.6MB) is a free accessible PDF outlining how to test native apps and the web for accessibility on Android and iOS. It provides an overview of accessibility settings, how to use them and common testing tools. Instructions on how to test content are provided for Android Talkback, iOS VoiceOver, zoom and switch settings. Also included are some testing tips, differences between testing mobile web and native apps, as well as an explanation of gestures and how to use them. This is a great document to use if you are testing, developing or designing apps and need to understand how accessible your content is and how usable it is for people of different abilities.  Note: The details are correct at the time of writing and based on iOS 9+ and Android 4.4+. New releases on both platforms may mean the details change or are adjusted slightly. Additionally, Android features can be inconsistent across devices and versions. The document flags issues where known, however, there may be further issues.  Sounding out the web: accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing people [Part 1]  Posted on Monday, 13 February 2017 by David Swallow  Category: UX   The largely visual nature of the web means that we tend to focus on supporting people who are blind or partially sighted. But deaf and hard of hearing people are often overlooked. I spoke with Ruth MacMullen, who is an academic librarian and copyright specialist from York in the UK, about her experience of being deaf and how it affects her use of the web. “It’s a matter of quite ferocious debate at times,” explains Ruth, on the topic of preferred nomenclature for deafness and hearing loss. “For me, it depends on what sort of mood I’m in. If I’m feeling a bit shy about it, I think ‘hearing impaired’ sounds a bit softer than ‘deaf.’ Sometimes I say ‘hard of hearing.’ That’s usually enough to tell people that you’ve got a problem hearing, that you need a bit of extra help, a bit of extra consideration.” Learning to hear Ruth was born profoundly deaf, meaning she has little to no residual hearing. Many people who are born deaf learn to communicate using sign language, such as British or American Sign Language, as their first language, and they identify with the Deaf community (spelled with a capital D in this case so as to refer to the Deaf community as opposed to the hearing condition). Ruth’s parents had been open to her learning sign language, but they were concerned that she’d depend on it completely. Instead, they were hoping for her to make the most of what little hearing she had and for her to try the latest hearing technologies. Powerful hearing aids gave Ruth some hearing, and with the support of a speech and language therapist, she learned to speak. When she was 13, Ruth had a cochlear implant fitted, which she found to be transformative. A cochlear implant is an electronic device that replaces the function of the damaged inner ear. Unlike hearing aids, which make sounds louder, cochlear implants replicate hearing by electrically stimulating the auditory nerves of the inner ear. Ruth’s cochlear implant made a tremendous difference to her hearing, and when she was 23, she had a second one fitted. The combination of cochlear implants and hearing aids gave Ruth—who’s now 30—what she describes as “pretty reasonable hearing.” Although Ruth now has access to a variety of sounds, her hearing loss still affects her day-to-day life. She cites an example of working in a busy open-plan office, where spontaneous and informal conversations often spring up: “A lot of information is shared by accident. I’m aware I miss all that and it feels like a shame. People need to be aware of that, and if there’s something important, they should try and draw you in, but it’s impossible to do that all the time. Accessibility is often built around structures and planning, isn’t it? So I think ‘unplanned accessibility’ is a really hard thing.” Structuring the web A similar lack of structure and planning among many developers hinders Ruth’s ability to use the web. The growing number of videos shared online, particularly through live-streaming platforms, such as Facebook Live or Periscope, are seldom subtitled. Subtitles (called closed captions in the United States and Canada) are words shown at the bottom of videos to explain what is being said or happening. “If subtitles aren’t possible, then at least provide a description of what the video is about,” appeals Ruth. “That’s increasingly missing as people get more casual about posting content.” She recalls a video of Aretha Franklin that a friend shared on Facebook: “I see her playing the piano and I think, ‘What song is she playing? There’s absolutely no description. It’s not that I need to hear every word, but sometimes I have no idea what’s happening.” For deaf and hard of hearing people, who rely heavily on visual information, Ruth can’t overstate the importance of structured content, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. “It makes a big difference because if you’re lacking in one sense, you make up for it with other senses.” Well-structured information helps people decide whether to engage with content, and it can help stem information overload. “If you can’t make informed choices about what you pay attention to, you can get lost very quickly,” warns Ruth. “If I find a website that’s poorly structured—bad headings, bad layout, maybe too much on one page—I find that very hard to cope with.” My next post shares some of the things that make life easier for Ruth on the web, and we offer some practical guidance on how to improve accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing people.

The Paciello Group meetup – Brighton Thursday 13th  Posted on Wednesday, 5 October 2016 by Henny Swan  Category: News   A few of us from The Paciello Group will be gathering in Brighton next week for our annual Tech Team Meetup. It seems too good an opportunity to miss hosting a meetup, so we’ll all be at the Caxton Arms from 6 p.m. on Thursday, 13th October.  The Caxton is a 2-minute walk from the station if you’re coming from out of Brighton, and it’s central if you live in town. It also does a mean “burger.” So come and join us for a pint or two—we’d love to see you.  Challenges, opportunities and the potential for low-vision access  Posted on Friday, 21 July 2017 by Matthew Atkinson  Category: Development   This is an opinion piece, looking at one slice of accessibility, to highlight some trends and possibilities. All of the computing devices, platforms and assistive technologies discussed within empower people (the author included) and are a vital part of the progress that has been and is being made. The ideal, and the current reality In the physical world, we may need glasses, magnifiers, telescopes, to help us perceive physical things, but in the electronic world, the content—and even the interface to that content—can, and should, adapt to us. My ideal electronic system is one in which information is presented in a way that I can access “just like that”—without the need to look through the limiting lens of a screen magnifier (as empowering as such lenses are these days).  Panning and scrolling are the necessary evils of screen-magnification. The physical and cognitive load of being zoomed in to a small area of the overall screen, constantly panning about to find content of interest can present bigger barriers than you might think. It can be tiring, and is easy to get lost, or miss important content because it’s in an unexpected area of the overall screen.  Representation of full-screen magnification. The user is zoomed into a specific area of the overall screen. They must pan around the “real” screen to find content and interface controls to operate. The challenges In recent years, some challenges to progress towards our ideal of adaptation have cropped up. Layout on the Web becomes rigid Web pages aren’t like physical documents: they don’t have to become huge and unwieldy when enlarged like photocopied paper: the content within a web page can be “re-flowed”, scrolling vertically if it became too big to fit on-screen at once. That’s how it (usually) worked in the olden days: web content was enlarged by increasing the base font size, and scrolled vertically—nice and manageable, even when using screen-magnification (in which case people could either pan across each line to read it, or opt to keep the content narrow, to fit within their zoom area, and just scroll a bit more, keeping navigation simple). However, as layout on the web became more sophisticated, and perhaps because of user expectations from physical documents, the desire to preserve that layout when the page is zoomed took hold, and “full-page” (2D) zoom became the default, whereas “text-only” (vertical-scrolling) zoom became an increasingly hard-to-find option, within the ever-leaner browser UIs. This put screen-magnification users in the peculiar and perplexing world of parallax scrolling, where the screen, and the web content, must be panned independently, each in two different directions. It is at this point that most people would feel that both limbs and brain cells are in short supply, and that there must be a better way.  Representation of trying to access “full-page” (2D) zoomed web content whilst also using full-screen magnification. The user has to pan around the web content, which is within a window that, in turn, is within the “real” screen, which the user also has to pan around. This creates two levels of 2D scrolling, which is hard, and tiring, to navigate successfully. So many pixels! High-resolution screens (sometimes termed “retina” displays) provide clearer, more vivid rendering of text and images, though unfortunately for those with low vision, they also have tended to cause the subtitles and credits on TV shows, and the menus on computer screens, to appear even more tiny than before. The all-new mobile paradigm… isn’t, quite Modern smartphones and smartwatches provide new ways to interact and can be wonderfully empowering, especially when it comes to navigating the world around independently (with maps apps, and apps to say which platform your train is on, and the like). They have helped content and app authors come up with new ways to bring people the information they need, in simpler ways, often depending on where (and when) they are. This shift to a new way of doing things offered a lot of potential to bring assistive technologies into the mainstream, and do things differently, in pursuit of the goal of adaptivity. However, even the smallest-screened devices fall back on the traditional “magnifier” approach to help people with vision impairment. If zooming into a large desktop monitor is frustrating, then having to zoom and pan around a small ‘phone screen really makes one feel boxed in. Further, many people find some small on-screen text hard to read, and many people might benefit from in-built features such as magnifiers in ‘phones, but such features are often labelled as “accessibility” features, which most people don’t really understand, or identify as being helpful to them. Some opportunities The above challenges, however, have presented some opportunities for improving accessibility—in some cases to all users; not just people with vision impairments. Layout becomes responsive One consequence of the way in which modern browsers zoom layout is that, whilst the content gets bigger, the “viewport” (the conceptual available space for the content) is also getting smaller—when the content is enlarged, the viewport can accommodate less content. This is actually a familiar situation: ‘phones and small tablets are the everyday small-screen devices, and the techniques that enable web-content to adapt to differing viewport sizes can be used to improve desktop accessibility. In fact, with mobile-first design, the “also happens to be accessible” mobile design can be seen as taking precedence, and only adapting to larger viewports available on some tablet and desktop devices if need be. Crisper zoomed content One benefit to such high resolutions being available to all is that scaling features in operating systems have necessarily had to not only continue to be supported, but made easier and simpler to access. Further, whilst it may not benefit all people with vision-impairments, interfaces and content that have been zoomed on a high-resolution display will benefit from those added pixels, and do appear clearer than they would on earlier low-resolution displays. Global minimum font size—starting steps It’s not just about content (web or otherwise); users need to be able to perceive a user interface in order to be able to interact with it. Most operating systems provide a usually-optional means for apps to support large text. iOS has the “Dynamic Type” API that app developers must explicitly support; Android offers the ability to specify an interface in flexible units that adapt to both the size of the display and the user’s preferred base font size or zoom factor (though only a small range is presently permitted, so that apps still fit on the screen). These developments are welcome, but they can only go so far: the layout of an app might change a little from ‘phone to tablet, but it is still fundamentally fixed, as all variations have to be anticipated and designed by the developer in advance, so it cannot adapt to users who need even larger fonts, or perhaps people with dexterity difficulties who require large touch targets, or both at the same time. Surely there must be a better way? The potential—for all There is a better way! The world of academic research has a lot to offer in terms of innovative approaches to adaptation that can improve accessibility for people with various impairments—either due to disability or situation—and even multiple impairments at the same time. In future articles, we will look at some of these adaptations.  CVAA for Fostering Innovation and Change  Posted on Wednesday, 9 April 2014 by Sarah Horton  Category: Strategy   At TPG we are committed to advancing accessibility, and we look for ways to drive innovation and change in the way accessibility is approached and implemented. Laws and policies are strong drivers for accessibility, and in this article we talk about U.S. legislation that addresses accessibility in communication and media products and services. We believe these rules will advance accessibility thinking worldwide, and will result in innovative products and services that are designed to provide an accessible and enjoyable user experience for everyone. CVAA is short for the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act. It’s a U.S. law that was signed into effect by President Obama in October 2010, for the purpose of ensuring that accessibility requirements keep pace with advances in communication technologies. Title I: Communications Access covers communication services and equipment and Title II: Video Programming covers media accessibility. Both require communication and video manufacturers and service providers to address the needs of people with disabilities in their products and services. The FCC provides a helpful high-level overview (PDF). For those who want to really dig in, there’s loads of good information in the Final Report and Order (PDF), which includes the final rules as well as discussion of the comments received during the process of drafting the law. This 302-page document gives a good sense of the purpose and intention behind the law, for anyone who has the time and staying power to read it through. There are two aspects of CVAA that we find especially supportive of accessible user experience. One is the open-endedness of the rules, defining performance objectives but not dictating precisely how manufacturers must achieve them. This leaves the door open for manufacturers to take new approached to accessible interfaces, and for innovation be a market differentiator. Another is the rule that requires manufacturers to consider accessibility early in the design process, and document evidence that they have done so. The inclusion of this requirement as law is a powerful driver for change in how we design and build digital products. Encouraging Innovation through Flexibility CVAA does not include a specific standard against which to measure products and services. Instead, CVAA obligates manufacturers and service providers to make their products and services “accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.” And to describe the requirements of that obligation, CVAA uses “performance objectives,” defining accessible, usable, and compatible (see Appendix: CVAA Performance Objectives). Unlike WCAG and Section 508, which provide precise guidance and specifications related to, for example, providing text alternatives for images, CVAA’s performance objectives are broadly defined, more like the functional requirements in Section 508. They are composed of the objective—“Operable without vision”—and the directive—“Provide at least one mode that does not require user vision.” They do not include specifications for how to meet the objective, such as by providing text alternatives for images. On the one hand, this makes the task of achieving accessibility more difficult for designers and manufacturers. With standards like WCAG and Section 508, there is clear guidance on how to comply with accessibility requirements. But on the other hand, it leaves room for manufacturers and service providers to devise innovative approaches to achieving performance objectives. In a market as competitive as communication and video products and services, there’s an opportunity for manufacturers and service providers to stand out, by creating innovative products and services that are not only “accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,” but provide an excellent user experience for everyone. Requiring Integration of Accessibility in the Design Process In the CVAA documents, there’s a clear understanding that accessibility cannot be an after-the-fact consideration—that manufacturers will not be able to successfully comply with the law without changing their design and development processes to support accessibility from the start. This prerequisite is part of the rationale behind CVAA’s phased in implementation approach: “We find that phasing in these obligations is appropriate due to the need for covered entities to implement accessibility features early in product development cycles.” The requirement is supported by several rules. Section 14.20 Obligations, (b) Product design, development, and evaluation, describes the requirements: (1) Manufacturers and service providers must consider performance objectives set forth in section 14.21 at the design stage as early as possible and must implement such performance objectives, to the extent that they are achievable. (2) Manufacturers and service providers must identify barriers to accessibility and usability as part of such evaluation. Later sections describe the requirements for documenting efforts around accessibility. Section 14.31 Recordkeeping, describes how manufacturers are obligated to record their efforts: (1) information about the manufacturer’s or service provider’s efforts to consult with individuals with disabilities; (2) descriptions of the accessibility features of its products and services; and (3) information about the compatibility of its products and services with peripheral devices or specialized customer premise equipment commonly used by individuals with disabilities to achieve access. The rules go on to explain that the manufacturer or service provider must sign and file an annual compliance certificate containing updates on the above information. These rules move accessibility from an after-the-fact compliance exercise to a proactive approach that requires that accessibility is integral to the entire process. The record-keeping requirements ensure that the integration effort will be ongoing. CVAA and Accessible User Experience At TPG we know that an integrated practice of accessibility is needed if we are to truly advance access to digital products and services for people with disabilities. We call this practice Accessible User Experience, or Accessible UX. With Accessible UX, accessibility is a requirement from the beginning of the design process, and people with disabilities are included in user research activities. As such, CVAA’s process requirements for including accessibility requirements at the design stage and documenting engagement with people with disabilities map perfectly to an Accessible UX approach. We strongly recommend that communication and video manufacturers and service providers consider adopting an Accessible UX approach to meet their obligations under CVAA. You can learn more about the origins of CVAA, how it’s being implemented, and what results we can look forward to in the interview, CVAA with Larry Goldberg, conducted by yours truly, from A Podcast for Everyone, sponsored by TPG, Rosenfeld Media, UIE, and O’Reilly.

Is Accessibility a Supply or Demand Issue?  Posted on Friday, 6 February 2015 by Mike Paciello  Category: Standards   Jim Tobias has me thinking….Is the 508 Refresh delay a Supply (Industry) or a Demand (Government) issue? For years I’ve been advocating for economic stimulus and price subsidies – Federal/State sponsored rebates, grants, and refundable credits. Long term investment in the underlying technology, open source systems, applications and architecture to improve cost structure thereby generating organic market competition. My position (okay, my rant!) has always been that industry and big business won’t invest in accessibility if there’s no business value proposition. Talk to any business – anywhere –  ask them where accessibility lies in their list of product/service priorities. Accessibility doesn’t make the top 10 list, ever. Lots of great intention; a few ‘feel good’ marketing messages; an upbeat Tweet now and then. But let’s face it, industry is in the business of making money. The accessibility business today is about compliance; it’s viewed as a cost of doing business, not one that generates revenue, never mind profit! I strongly believe that economic stimulus is crucial to getting our industry — the accessibility industry — off the ground. I want to jump start it just like the Feds did for green technologies and the alternative energy industry. But Jim really has me thinking about this Supply and Demand thing….If the Feds and States and all those agencies REALLY stuck to their guns and followed through on the fundamental principal of 508 procurement enforcement……if the Feds and States FUNDED Section 508 rather than starving it as an UNFUNDED mandate…..if xthe Feds and States INVESTED their its own infrastructure….well then….just maybe….just maybe we could get this vision of EMPOWERMENT truly off the ground…. …..I’m not sure….what do YOU think???  Developing a Manifesto for Accessible UX  Posted on Friday, 22 August 2014 by David Sloan  Category: Strategy   Last month, a few TPG folks attended the UXPA 2014 conference in an astonishingly hot and sunny London. As well as meeting with friends and colleagues old and new, and having some great discussions about our future work plans, Sarah Horton, Léonie Watson and I also ran a conference workshop on Developing a Manifesto for Accessible User Experience.  We’ve observed the use of manifestos as rallying points for other emerging philosophies in the field of digital design and development. As we try to move thinking of accessibility from technical checkpoint testing towards a mature approach of full integration into UX activity, we thought it might be a helpful exercise to develop a small set of common statements and beliefs that UX professionals can use to describe what we mean by Accessible UX. This manifesto could become a simple tool to help us develop a mutual understanding of what we’re trying to achieve, to help organisations integrate accessibility into practice and create genuinely inclusive high-quality digital experiences for everyone, regardless of disability or age. We wanted to get some input from our colleagues in the UX field, including experienced accessibility specialists, UX professionals with a strong interest in accessibility, and people keen to learn more about how to better integrate accessibility into their UX activity. So we facilitated what we found to be an intense and demanding—but ultimately productive—3-hour session, where we looked at three topic areas:  Sharing the challenges we currently face in effectively integrating accessibility into user experience activity. This helped us to collectively understand the breadth and nature of the barriers that we face in trying to broaden awareness, understanding and responsibility for designing more accessible user experiences. Sharing an understanding and appreciation of the definition, purpose and aims of a manifesto in describing, supporting and advancing a new practice or approach. We discussed what people understand by a “manifesto”, and existing manifestos that might inform our thinking. Examples we considered included the Manifesto for Agile Software Development , the  Lean UX Manifesto, and the UK Government Data Services (GDS) Design Principles. Developing an initial version of a Manifesto for Accessible UX. This was the really hard part and, while we made some progress, we still have a lot of work to do! We identified three categories, respectively covering where we are now, where we want to be, and how we’ll get there, and created a set of position statements for each.  We’re now in the process of refining these statements and shaping them into a meaningful first draft, with the help of the workshop participants. After this, we need to understand how the Manifesto can be of most use to accessible UX advocates, but more importantly, for organisations to use as a reference point in their work. We’ll be sure to update you on our progress. In the meantime, we’d like to thank all the workshop participants for their contributions so far. Update (22 August): Our workshop slides are now available on Slideshare.    Examples of ‘skip links’ on some bank sites  Posted on Tuesday, 21 August 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   While discussing long descriptions on the HTML working group mailing list I took a look at how some sites provide skip links as an example of contingent visible display of content as a more palatable design concept for some accessibility features, as against always displayed or always visually hidden.  Poor implementation of skip links on some bank web sites I started looking at banks as I knew the bank I use implemented a skip  link that was displayed on focus, rather than always hidden or always  visible, and thought this was a good example of a design compromise,  whereby the feature was available to those that may benefit (keyboard  users), but does not effect the visual design for mouse users. I didn’t start out looking for poor ‘skip link’ implementation examples, but quickly found them… here are some random examples of bank sites that implement the display on focus skip link, which Jim thatcher uses, and discusses in his article Skip Navigation Links The Halifax bank web site visible skip link box displayed on focus, outlined to ease identification The halifax bank site has the following links (including 4 skip ‘jump’ links) that display on focus as a blue box (no visible text) that partially obscures other page content:  Jump to content  Jump to site navigation Jump to site tools Jump to search  Contact us  Accessibility statement  The co-operative bank site co-op \\'skip navigation\\' link partially obscured by the bank logo The Co-op bank site has 3 skip links that display on focus, the links have a transparent background so are obscured by the other content.  Skip to main navigation Skip to main content Skip to footer content  The HSBC bank site HSBC \\'skip page header and navigation\\' link  Has a nice clean skip link that displays on focus, too bad it doesn’t work in FireFox. Some working implementations First direct bank \\'skip to main content\\' link  First direct bank has a nice clearly visible skip link that displays on focus and works as it should. Standard Chartered bank has a nice clearly visible skip link that displays on focus and works as it should. Scotiabank has a nice clearly visible skip link that displays on focus and works as it should.   Design like we give a damn! Accessibility @W3C  Posted on Wednesday, 12 November 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   Lots of things happened at the W3C TPAC 2104 conference. It was a busy week in web standards.  HTML5 became an official W3C Recommendation, the W3C turned 20, and the web itself celebrated its 25th anniversary. In amongst all these momentous events there was still time for the assembled W3C participants to explore new ideas through a series of lightning talks, and now the lightning talks are starting to be made available for everyone to share. A highlight of TPAC, for me, was to be in the audience for the lightning talks and hear my dear friend and colleague Léonie Watson, in just 4 minutes, say so much about what we as participants in the development of web standards at the W3C could do, to re-invigorate and broaden our approach, to fulfill the promise of an accessible web.

Accessibility in an Agile lifecycle  Posted on Thursday, 30 March 2017 by Justin Stockton  Category: Development   When you first started reading about Scrum, Kanban, or one of the other Agile frameworks, you probably came across topics like user stories, sprint planning, minimum viable product, and continuous integration. Each Agile framework has its own set of terms, lingo, and way of doing things which can make learning what and when to do something a challenge. What is important to understand, is that all Agile frameworks have one thing in common; a desire to help you manage the risk associated with building something. This is why Agile frameworks like Scrum work really well when applied to software development projects. In fact, Agile and Accessibility really should go hand-in-hand, but for some reason, even the most ardent practitioners of Agile can have a hard time figuring out how and when to include accessibility. Before we start talking about how frameworks like Scrum can help us be better at accessibility, let’s step back and get to know what started it all, the Agile Manifesto: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan While the secondary concerns are important, the primary concerns are more critical to success. — The Agile Manifesto  For decades, when a software development team came together to build something it was known that everyone had a role and a job to do. What changed with Agile was that it broke down the barriers that separated developers, business analysts, UX, and QA. Agile did this by establishing a set of principles that brings everyone together starting at the project kickoff to talk and collaborate on what and how a product should be built. This is the same process that accessibility professionals have advocated for many years. Remove the wall that reserves the accessibility professional for testing at the end of the project after everything has been built and instead make us a member of the team from the start. We’ll talk with the analysts, collaborate with developers, provide guidance to UX, and test alongside QA so that, we the team, have a better understanding of how persons with disabilities can and will use assistive technology to interact with our software in browsers and mobile devices. We even have a few guidelines that, with a basic understanding, will help everyone on the team begin writing better user stories, code, and test cases, that help the team build software that not only works and accomplishes the needs of the business, but is usable by everyone. Over the next few weeks we’ll take a deeper dive into Agile frameworks, like Scrum and Kanban, to provide practitioners with some ways they can improve the way they talk about and work with accessibility when building software.  Accessibility in Practice: A process-driven approach to accessibility  Posted on Monday, 31 March 2014 by Sarah Horton  Category: Strategy   By Sarah Horton and David Sloan Note: This is the manuscript version of the paper we presented at the 7th Cambridge Workshop on Universal Access and Assistive Technology (CWUAAT ’14). The paper appears in the book Inclusive Designing: Joining Usability, Accessibility, and Inclusion, Copyright © 2014 Springer. Introduction Attention to accessibility usually comes into play in the later phases of product development. Accessibility audits are typically performed during quality assurance and user acceptance testing phases. Remediation for any issues identified in the audit usually happens in code. However, the best fix for many complex accessibility issues may be to revisit the overall design approach; yet reworking designs at this late phase has a significant impact on timelines and processes. Any recommendation involving alternative designs is therefore usually unwelcome. Instead, the issues remain unresolved, or are resolved in a fashion that achieves technical accessibility but offers a compromised user experience. The best approach to accessible user experience is to integrate accessibility into the design and development process. When accessibility is part of the practice of every member of the product development team, and when accessible features and functionality are built into design, content, and code, the result is a product that is accessible and enjoyable for everyone. As user experience consultants with The Paciello Group (TPG), a U.S.-based consultancy that provides IT accessibility services to companies, agencies, and organizations, we see a growing interest in pursuing a more holistic approach to accessibility, one that brings accessibility into the practice of designing and building web sites and applications. In this position paper, we explore drivers for this interest, including laws and policies that require early attention to accessibility. We present a framework for integrating accessibility into product development processes to bring about a fundamental change in how we approach accessibility. The Value of Accessible User Experience Good user experience increases satisfaction and enjoyment. Customers who have a good experience place higher value on, and are more loyal to, a product and its producer. An accessible user experience brings the benefits of good user experience to people with disabilities. This, in turn, increases the pool of loyal customers. Good UX is good business Good user experience is increasingly recognized as a desirable attribute of digital products, such as web sites. It effectively extends the objective components of usability to consider more experiential, subjective qualities that emerge after using a digital product (Hassenzahl, 2013). The commercial value of providing a quality user experience is increasingly recognized (Nielsen and Gilutz). Companies that are customer focused, with products that satisfy and delight, see an increase in loyalty behaviors, including repurchase and referrals (Hoisington and Naumann, 2003). From an accessibility standpoint, how can we ensure that people with diverse accessibility needs, including people with visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive impairments, have a quality user experience—one that is, in the words of Hassenzahl, worthwhile? Put another way, how do we achieve universal usability, with “more than 90% of all households as successful users of information and communications services at least once a week” (Shneiderman, 2000, p. 85). Note in Shneiderman’s definition, it’s not enough to provide products that are usable. To reap the shared benefits of accessible user experience, a large and diverse population must have successful experiences with digital products. Compliance does not ensure quality Involving people with disabilities effectively in a digital product development project can lead to valuable and often unexpected insights on how design problems can be solved (Pullin, 2010). However, current approaches to web accessibility tend to be driven by technical guideline conformance (Cooper, Sloan, Kelly, and Lewthwaite, 2012). A focus on guideline conformance can leave little room to consider context of use, and provides no direct requirement to consider user experience of people with disabilities (Sloan and Kelly, 2011). The result is that approaching accessibility from a purely technical conformance perspective can leave digital products falling short of providing people with disabilities with a quality user experience (Power, Freire, Petrie, and Swallow, 2012). Retrofitting is costly, on all fronts Remediating accessibility barriers at the end of the design cycle or after launch is expensive and ineffective. Given time, budget, and technical constraints, the scope for improving the experience of people with disabilities may be limited to reducing the impact of specific discrete accessibility barriers, or worse, creating a parallel version to accommodate specific disabilities. This “separate, but not equal” approach to achieving compliance produces “accessibility solutions” that are typically inferior in content and functionality, and are neglected over time, lacking the attention given to corresponding mainstream products (Wentz, Jaeger, and Lazar, 2011). When accessibility efforts are fueled by compliance needs, prioritized based on perceived impact, and addressed at the end of the product development lifecycle, the quality of the user experience for people with disabilities will have little influence on the work that is done. Filling the gap with accessible user experience Accessible user experience fills the gap between accessibility as a technical quality assurance exercise and accessibility as an attribute of an overall quality customer experience. By adopting a practice of accessible user experience, product designers and developers work to ensure that as many as possible of the target audience, including those with disabilities, can successfully achieve desirable goals when interacting with a product. These goals can be task-oriented, but may also be more experiential. In either case, the outcome will be positive, both for the user and the organization. Using Standards to Drive Process Change Some accessibility-related standards contain provisions that are directly related to process. These provide an opportunity to integrate accessibility into culture and processes, as organizations are required to address the needs of people with disabilities throughout the product development lifecycle, and to document their efforts. Fueling the effort with process-related requirements may help remove attitudinal barriers to integrating accessibility. For example, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) in the United States presents performance objectives that ensure that equipment and services are accessible and usable. The rules include the directive that “Manufacturers and service providers must consider performance objectives … at the design stage as early as possible and must implement such performance objectives, to the extent that they are achievable” (CVAA, 2011). Similarly, the U.S. Information and Communication Technology Standards and Guidelines, a.k.a. Section 508 Refresh, requires that product developers include accessibility in design and development. These standards also require that people with disabilities are included in the product design and evaluation process, and that the needs of people with disabilities are considered in market research efforts (Section 508 Refresh). Complementary to technical standards for measuring accessibility of digital resources, other standards specifically focus on the process of accessible technology design, encouraging inclusive design throughout the system design lifecycle. As an example of a process standard, BS 8878 was launched in the UK in 2010 to define a procedure for commissioning and implementing accessible web sites—whether developed internally by an organization, or outsourced (British Standards Institute, 2010). Thus, BS 8878 is written to support managerial staff throughout the project lifecycle, and does not demand in-depth technical knowledge. We see these process-related standards, guidelines, and reporting requirements providing an opportunity for organizations to adopt holistic support for accessible user experience, and build accessibility in from the start. Given a requirement to consult with people with disabilities, include people with disabilities in user research, and measure accessibility and usability of products against performance objectives—these are tasks that cannot be undertaken and reported on after the fact without slowing timelines and expending significant additional resources. When attention to the user experience of people with disabilities is part of the overall process, requirements will be easier to achieve, reporting will be more credible, and the outcome will be a better process and product, for everyone. A Practice of Accessible User Experience Designing and engineering a quality user experience for people with disabilities requires an organizational commitment, shared responsibility and accountability for accessibility, and supporting resources to establish a practice of accessible user experience (Horton and Quesenbery, 2014). A key challenge to establishing a practice of accessibility within an organization is overcoming perceptions about the difficulty, complexity, effort, and cost of achieving accessibility. The challenge of changing current practices to ones that support accessibility is often seen as insurmountable. To illustrate this challenge we provide the following scenario. A large, decentralized organization receives accessibility audits of its websites. Initially the audits are seen as too general, prompting feedback that site developers require specific code changes. Subsequent audits include detailed feedback, identifying exact locations of problems and code fixes. The detailed audits raise other concerns—namely, that there is too much that needs fixing. When asked what approach would work, the response is that nothing will solve this—the culture is too complex, with too many devolved responsibilities and competing objectives, to apply an effective organization-wide strategy for achieving accessibility. This scenario illustrates the negative perceptions that arise from approaching accessibility as an audit and remediation process—one that involves identifying problems and fixing them. It also recognizes the challenges of implementing large-scale process change within an organization. However, process change is what makes accessibility an achievable objective. In the section on partnering with accessibility experts we discuss the role accessibility trainers and integrators—consultants who are sympathetic to organizational culture, and through practical and pragmatic approaches, position accessibility as an achievable objective. In the next section we talk about the role of organizations in making a strategic commitment to accessibility, using a framework of disruptive innovation to effect process change. Make an organizational commitment to accessibility For most companies, introducing accessibility into the product development process may be experienced as a disruptive innovation, as it introduces a new value proposition to the organizational culture. Initiatives that fail to appreciate and work with disruptive attributes may not be successful (Christenson, 2011). Therefore, it is crucial that organizational leadership recognizes the commitment as disruptive, and follows innovation adoption best practices when initiating and implementing accessibility. Everett Rodgers offers a model for introducing an innovation process within an organization (Rogers, 2003). Here we use his model as the basis for implementing accessibility within an organization. We show the Rodgers phases and definitions, mapped to the context of adopting a practice of accessible user experience (following the Rogers definitions and shown in italics). In the Initiation phases, the organization acknowledges that current design and development processes do not produce accessible products:  Agenda-setting: General organizational problems that may create a perceived need for innovation—Current design and development practices do not produce accessible products. Matching: Fitting the problem from the organization’s agenda with an innovation—Adopting a practice of accessible user experience.  In the Implementation phases, the organization revisits current organizational structures and design and development practices, and creates a plan for successfully adopting and integrating accessibility into practice:  Redefining/Restructuring: The innovation is modified and re-invented to fit the organization, and organizational structures are altered—Accessible user experience is defined within the context of the organization and the digital technologies it produces or uses. Clarifying: The relationship between the organization and the innovation is defined more clearly—Responsibilities and required accessibility skillset and tools for delivering objectives are defined and assigned within the product team. Routinizing: The innovation becomes an ongoing element in the organization’s activities, and loses its identity—The organization builds products with accessibility built-in; accessibility is an integral part of the quality assurance process.  Establish roles and responsibilities Product development teams come in many shapes and sizes. Product development processes range from distinct teams responsible for discrete aspects of a product to integrated teams that share responsibility for multiple dimensions. Some “teams” are composed of one person who manages all aspects of product development. Regardless, for accessible user experience, the responsibilities incumbent on each role must be defined and assimilated by the responsible party. A systematic, guidelines-based approach is to map the Web Accessibility Initiatives Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) success criteria to the roles on the product team. The WAI-Engage Community Group is currently exploring this approach on their collaborative wiki. In the Accessibility Responsibility Breakdown (ARB) matrices, responsibility for meeting the WCAG 2.0 levels and success criteria are mapped to different project management, research, design, content, and development roles. This could be a useful starting point for establishing primary roles and responsibilities within a project team; although care should be taken to treat accessibility as a holistic and shared process across the project team and beyond. Establish an accessibility infrastructure Take steps to integrate accessibility into the infrastructure of the organization. Like whiteboards and post-its, OmniGraffle and Photoshop, GitHub and Sublime Text, make accessibility resources part of the product development toolkit.  Organizational policy: Every organization has policies—whether explicit operational policies, or implicit practices that are part of the organizational culture. Standards-based development is a good example: many product developers hold as policy developing to standards. An organizational policy can go far in articulating an organizational commitment on accessibility, and building an “accessibility-first” mindset across the organization (Kline, 2011; Feingold, 2013). Content strategy: Organizations have a growing appreciation for the importance of content strategy. Including accessibility in an overall content strategy makes accessibility a strategic priority (Kissane, 2010). Code repositories: Managing an accessible code repository for common user interface components, such as menus, tabs, date pickers, is a worthwhile investment. It streamlines development time, and provides a better, more consistent, more accessible user experience. There is a range of publicly available examples of accessible user interface design patterns, such as the Accessible jQuery User Interface Components Demonstration , which can be incorporated into internal repositories. Style guides: Rules and conventions that support best practices help teams produce better products. Integrating accessibility into style guides helps build in accessibility features by following established and share best practices (Lynch and Horton, 2009). Content and development tools: Tools can make accessibility a struggle, or something that is baked in. Look for content management software that supports accessible templates and promotes accessible content production: for example, adding equivalent text to images and marking up content using semantic markup. Look for development tools that support standards-based markup and code validation.  Build accessibility expertise on the product development team Ultimately, accessible user experience requires a commitment from every member of the product development team, and everyone shares accountability for providing accessibility within his or her realm of responsibility. When recruiting new team members, include experience with accessibility as a job requirement, and list accessibility-related tasks in the list of job responsibilities. Assess the familiarity and proficiency with accessibility at hiring time—whether for UX practitioners, developers or managers. Has the applicant been exposed to accessibility in her training and education? How much experience does she have with working on projects involving accessibility? Prospective employees should be able to present direct evidence of involvement with and knowledge of accessibility practices. Many programs and positions include accessibility in the description, but in reality provide minimal exposure. The scarcity of any formal accessibility qualifications that could be used to assess an individual’s professional skills in accessibility is a hindrance to the approach of assessing prospective candidates. A professional IT Accessibility society has been in discussion, although arguments against this approach focus on the need to promote accessibility as a core professional skill rather than a specialty (Rush, 2012). Involve people with disabilities in the product development process Strategic product development begins with a definition of purpose, goals, and target audience. This important step creates a roadmap for the product development lifecycle, and a framework for decision-making. For accessible user experience, it is critical that people with disabilities are considered among the target audience. When the user experience of people with disabilities is integral to the strategic goals of the product, other pieces of the accessible user experience process fall into place. While participation of people with disabilities in usability evaluations towards the end of the design process can help to validate accessibility-related decisions taken earlier on, their involvement at an earlier stage can lead to valuable insights and potentially innovative approaches to design problems. For instance, user research helps teams identify content, functionality, and design strategies that will be welcomed by and useful to the product’s target audience. Including people with disabilities in user research helps ensure that accessibility is integrated into all aspects of a product. The needs of people with disabilities are not accommodated, but rather directly addressed, in decisions about content, design, and functionality. Involving people with disabilities does not mean consulting individually with people representing each and every type of disability, any more than user research means surveying a group large enough to fully represent the entire target audience. The range of needs and preferences for people with disabilities is the same as with all people—vast, diverse, and individualized—and we can learn a great deal and make informed design decisions by bringing in perspectives, from one person or one hundred. Whether through interviews, focus groups, surveys, or personas, for accessible user experience the only difference is that the definition of users includes people with disabilities. Establish partnerships with accessibility experts Accessibility consultants are often brought into a project in an auditor capacity, looking for and reporting on compliance violations. Cast in the role of “accessibility cops,” consultants often have limited positive impact on organizational accessibility awareness and processes. A better approach is to partner with accessibility experts. Bring consultants into projects early, as accessibility partners rather than compliance officers. Have accessibility expertise on projects, alongside strategy, design, programming, and content experts. An informed accessibility perspective is also important to help guide any process and method changes that may be needed to integrate accessibility into practice. For instance, user-centered research and design methods may need to be modified in order to recognize constraints related to the nature of participants’ impairments or other characteristics, and how that impacts on data collection mechanisms and the type of data that can be collected. Prior (2011) discusses how methods can be adapted to effectively involve people with severe speech and physical impairments as co-designers; Dickinson et al (2007) provide valuable advice on involving older people in user-centered design activities. For an effective partnership, accessibility experts should be mindful of the challenges facing designers and developers, particularly those relating to business-related constraints on design requirements, budget and timescales. Rather than point out all the ways a product fails to meet accessibility standards, give useful, actionable and achievable guidance on ways to capitalize on opportunities, such as new ways to involve a customer base of people with disabilities earlier in the design and development process, and to remedy issues. Look for opportunities to inform and train designers and developers on accessible user experience patterns and methods. Bring accessibility to the table as a challenge that is intriguing, worthwhile—and solvable. Conclusion People with disabilities are customers with demands and expectations for quality experiences like anyone else, or potential customers yet to be engaged. Providing an enjoyable and successful experience of products to customers has a high return on investment. Providing a compromised experience to people with disabilities is a lost opportunity, as well as a potential compliance issue. The most beneficial way to address accessibility is by broadening the definition of “target audience” to encompass the broad and ever-shifting range of ability, having each member of the product develop team assume responsibility and accountability for accessibility features, and providing resources and expert guidance to support a practice of accessible user experience. Our accessible user experience framework is intended to guide organizations in planning and implementing a strategy for integrating accessibility throughout the design lifecycle, and in particular ensuring that user experience design and inclusive design activities can be combined for positive benefit. Future work, as part of the authors’ roles as accessible user experience consultants with TPG, will involve supporting adoption of the framework and measuring its effectiveness. Key success criteria will include the quality of accessible user experience of digital products developed using the framework and the extent to which the framework can be practically adopted by organizations in different sectors. As an organization offering accessibility expertise, we will also explore the most effective and productive ways of working with organizations to implement the framework element, “establish partnerships with accessibility experts.” References  British Standards Institute (2010) BS 8878:2010—Web Accessibility Code of Practice.

Usability and accessibility opportunities in a web component world  Posted on Monday, 7 April 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   A discussion on the WHATWG list about the limitations/issues with the current design of the summary and details elements, brought forth the following comment:  [me: ] in the absence of browser making “clicks on (non-interactive) parts of the summary defer to the disclosure triangle.” how is  an author supposed to do this? [hixie:] The author isn’t supposed to do this. The whole point of semantic controls like this [details/summary] is that the user agent is the one that picks the user interface. Once we start talking about custom widgets, we’re in the space of Web components, at which point the author can do whatever the author wants. [emphasis mine] source: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2014Apr/0012.html Don’t fear – embrace Which got me to thinking that we should be embracing web components as an opportunity to improve the usability and accessibility of native HTML controls and content. It’s a little sad that the way to fix accessibility and usability in a native UI is to create a custom UI, rather than ensuring by design of the HTML feature that usability and accessibility are built in, but if it is to be, lets embrace it. A simple demo To this end, I have made a simple demo using the flipbox web component, to illustrate use of a web component to provide easy display of rich text alternatives for images using a natty interaction pattern:    The CSUN 2016 UXathon  Posted on Monday, 14 March 2016 by David Sloan  Category: ConferencesCategory: DevelopmentCategory: UX   Here’s your chance to help define what is meant by an accessible web experience! We’re interested in finding out more about how some common user interface design patterns can be made as useful as possible to use by people with disabilities, through The CSUN 2016 UXathon, at this year’s CSUN conference in San Diego.We’re very grateful to the CSUN conference organising team for their support in enabling this event to happen. The UXathon will take place through two activities:  An online Design Pattern Usability Study,  which will provide information for A hackday, exploring solutions  The results will be contributed to the W3C Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group to help improve WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices. You’ll be helping to improve the user experience for anyone using a site that makes use of these design patterns.   Stage 1: Design Pattern Usability Study We’re looking for people who use a range of assistive technologies and input devices, such as keyboards and voice input, to take part in a study evaluating some examples of different types of interactive web content. Each example is designed with accessibility in mind, but takes a different approach to the same problem. The study involves taking an online survey, which will ask you questions about your assistive technology use, and then invite you to use some user interface component examples, and report on your experience of using these examples.  Design Pattern Usability Survey Follow-up evaluation We’ll invite people who took part in the online survey to test the same examples as featured in the study, but this time in person, so that we can ask follow-up questions and invite participants to express their opinions in more detail. With participants’ permission, we will record these sessions, allowing designers and developers more insight, as they will also be able to see and hear how people interact with each example. If you’ll be at CSUN and would like to take part in this stage of the UXathon, we strongly encourage you to complete the online survey first. Stage 2: Hacking Solutions  For the second stage of the UXathon, we are looking for developers and designers to join us the morning of Saturday, March 26 from 9:00 – 12:00 in the Pier room of the Manchester Grand Hyatt, on the 3rd floor next to the Promenade foyer.  The purpose of this stage will be to take the feedback we’ve gathered from the online study and follow-up evaluations, and hack solutions to enhance the design patterns further. The results will be shared widely, and will be available for comment by those who cannot attend the CSUN Conference. Are you interested? If you’d like to take part, you can go directly to the online survey, or contact us directly by emailing csunuxathon@gmail.com with the subject CSUN UXathon.

Our colleagues at Deque are organising an aXe accessibility hackathon, exploring solutions using their aXe technology. For more information, see the Deque web site.  A web of anxiety: accessibility for people with anxiety and panic disorders [Part 1]  Posted on Tuesday, 14 August 2018 by David Swallow  Category: UX   Anyone booking a vacation has likely encountered persuasive notifications urging them to “Hurry, only 2 tickets left!” or to “Book now as 6 other people are viewing this hotel”. We’ve all fumbled to enter our credit-card details as an ominous timer counts down the number of minutes remaining to complete our transaction. The web is awash with all manner of so-called dark patterns, designed to convert visitors and part them from their money. While such intrusions can be a source of irritation or even stress for many people, they may be complete showstoppers for people with anxiety or panic disorders. Anxiety disorders comprise a range of mental illnesses that are characterised by excessive feelings of fear, apprehension, and dread. For example, social anxiety disorder is an intense fear of being embarrassed, humiliated, or judged negatively by others in a social or work setting. Claustrophobia is the fear of confined spaces. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in a situation that would be difficult to escape from. People with health anxiety have a preoccupation with the idea that they have (or will have) a physical illness. Panic disorders describe sudden, frequent, and intense feelings of panic or fear, sometimes for no clear reason. After asking about it on discussion forums, message boards and social media, I talked with several people with anxiety and panic disorders about aspects of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design that contribute to feelings of anxiety and panic. Several themes emerged: Urgency Anything that provokes a sense of urgency or scarcity was a commonly cited source of anxiety. This includes the previously mentioned persuasive notifications and time-limited transactions as well as more benign features, such as the countdown to the next episode on media players like Netflix or BBC iPlayer. Even security features that are designed to keep people safe and secure online can provoke feelings of anxiety. One respondent said, “I find 2FA [two-factor authentication] kind of stressful. ‘Enter this code!’ and watching the timeout tick down”. Another respondent lamented how “some sites intended to be inclusive and facilitate communication end up causing the opposite”. They described the often-frenetic nature of chat room platforms where “just logging on causes the user to be barraged by an attack of communication”, noting that this can be “very intense, hectic and panicky”. Unpredictability Whether it’s deciphering the doublespeak of opt-in or opt-out marketing checkboxes (“tick this checkbox if you DO NOT want to receive our newsletter”) or wondering whether you’ll have an opportunity to review your order before the confirmation page, the unpredictable nature of certain websites and apps was another commonly cited source of apprehension. One respondent described their anxiety at having accidentally “liked” someone’s photo on Instagram by double-tapping it—something they had not expected to happen: “I didn’t mean to ‘like’ it, but will I look weird or like a stalker if I leave it? Or will I look rude if I remove it? … I find Instagram immensely stressful”. Several described how read receipts—the system that shows whether a message has been delivered or read in apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger—can be a trigger for social anxiety. One respondent said: “You’re left wondering, have they read my message? Why aren’t they replying? Did I say something to upset them? Then you obsess over what you’ve written, trying to figure out if they could have misinterpreted it”. Powerlessness Going hand in hand with the unpredictability of websites and apps is the “overwhelming” sense of powerlessness they can provoke. Hiding key information, such as contact details or account-deactivation instructions, in difficult-to-reach corners of websites can result in users feeling helpless. One respondent described a recent experience with a pet-insurance provider: “Their website is set up to funnel you into a phone call with them, burying the online registration forms behind false walls, tricky wording and hidden links. I get anxiety talking on the phone, so it was a real challenge for me”. Targeted advertising (where the browsing habits of consumers are tracked and then used to provide them with more specific adverts) was another commonly cited source of anxiety, with many respondents feeling powerless to stop the intrusion. One described how “a lot of my particular anxieties came into full swing when I learned more about how online advertising works. When I noticed Facebook ‘Like’ buttons on unrelated pages and when ads follow me around. The feeling that I had no privacy was claustrophobic and has led to so many anxiety attacks I have lost count”. Sensationalism The final theme relates not to UI design but to content. We are living in an era of so-called fake news and media sensationalism, where information is deliberately distorted to push agendas and generate business. “Scaremongering and bias are sadly something our media are built on”, noted one respondent. “Bias and negative skewed thinking is already a problem with anxiety or depression, so to be led into panic through over the top and biased, often speculative garbage parading as news is a common problem”. This is particularly the case for medical information, where irresponsible or careless reporting can have serious consequences for anyone with health anxiety. According to one respondent: “Right now, the flu is a big fear and it seems journalists are really milking that for all it’s worth. So many articles about this healthy person dying or the ‘top five symptoms that might indicate flu that you might not have heard of’ or whatever. Often the article isn’t scary … but after reading that headline it’s hard to get into a better headspace”. My next post will explore how we can avoid or reduce anxiety and panic triggers on the web and offer some practical guidance on how to improve accessibility for people with anxiety and panic disorders.  An overview of PDF inaccessibility  Posted on Friday, 17 February 2017 by Jon Metz  Category: Development   There’s a lot of help online about making Portable Document Format (PDF) accessible. Even with all the advice out there, I still encounter people who find it difficult to make their documents friendly to people with disabilities. It seems a lot of people have a hard time translating what’s in a tutorial to the PDF they’re working on. Unlike fixing accessibility errors in HTML, the solution for most PDF errors is usually the same for any PDF. It’s actually difficult to have multiple solutions when fixing accessibility errors in PDFs. Unlike HTML, a PDF that’s only got rudimentary accessibility is usually still too hard to use. But why? What makes PDF inaccessible in the first place? Different approaches to the same problem Both HTML and PDF are documents. Both need some sort of application to read them. But what’s the fundamental difference between an HTML document and a PDF document? An HTML document is made with it’s structure in mind (at least it should be). On the other hand, PDFs are made with the layout in mind. PDFs essentially make your computer act like a printer. The output strives to be an exact representation of what the original document looked like. In HTML, the structure needs to be established in order to achieve the desired output. Typing a bunch of text into a text editor will have different outcomes when making HTML than a PDF. Formatting such as a clump of spaces or many hits of the enter key disappears when an HTML file is rendered. A PDF will look exactly the way it did in your text editor with formatting applied. Yet, there’s an important consideration going on with these two files. HTML is displaying text on a screen, while the PDF is displaying a representation of the text on the screen. In reality, what you’re seeing in a PDF is not actually text. First some history Remember I said that PDFs make your computer act like a printer? There’s a reason for that. The PDF file format is a subset of the PostScript page description language. A page description language is a programming language that describes the appearance of a printed page. PostScript changed the way printers work. Before PostScript, it was hard to print text along with images. Vector drawings took expensive machines to print. Glyphs for text had to be physically changed if you wanted to use a different font. Printing Raster images required separate people to write programs for various printers. PostScript converts pictures and text into a series of straight and Bézier vector curves. Vectors let you create a file with a code-based representation for everything that exist on a page. In years past, many printers shipped with fonts, but with PostScript, people could use fonts like those on their computer. While these features were super cool, PostScript came with its share of nuisances. For example, while it’s possible to display PostScript on the screen, it wasn’t very practical. If you wanted to view page 150, pages 1 through 149 had to process first. That took a lot of processing power on computers, which made the process very expensive. Enter PDF The Portable Document Format still generates output like PostScript. But it also introduced a structure storage system and advanced compression. And it interpreted the PostScript through tokenization. Tokenization is a way of breaking up something into a series of chunks to classify and label what the code means. Storing tokens that repeat allows software to display page 150 without having to render any of the pages before it. PDF also offered the ability to embed fonts inside the file format. This meant that end users didn’t need to have a bazillion fonts on their computers. PDF draws text on the page as vector lines and curves that are derived from the embedded fonts. A PDF is a visual representation of the source document. To display where text resides on a page, it uses the page as the reference for the text’s location. The structure of the page defines its content because it is a set of printing instructions. On its own, there is no inherent structure assigned to the objects in a PDF. Everything in a PDF exists in relation to the layout of the page. For PDF documents to have structure, there needs to be a means to separate the useless content from the content that matters (After many confusing conversations with me, this has become a dream of my wife’s for years). There are three basic ways content in a PDF is rendered. The first is how content is presented to the end user. This is the primary purpose of PDFs: displaying electronic print output on your computer screen. The second is how content is organized based on the way the document looks when you’re looking at it on the computer. The last way is optional. Defined tags can provide meaning to those tokens I mentioned earlier. A closer look behind the scenes PDF is basically a sequence of bytes. These bytes’ values can be represented as defined in ASCII plus white space characters. When the bytes are grouped together, they’re called tokens. The tokens represent a means to what is visually described in a PDF. Objects are data structures composed of small sets of bytes from a small set of data objects. A PDF file consists of one or more pages and the objects in it. The fact that it actually contains a page is very important. All content that came from the application that created the PDF is broken down into tokenized objects. These tokens describe the graphics and text on each page. Images in PDF documents aren’t added to the PDF file. Images are extracted and represented as data. Objects describe their transparency, values, location, color space, and so on. But the raw image is stored in the PDF file structure so it can be extracted from the PDF. Like images, text is extracted when the PDF is created. Therefore, text in a PDF aren’t actual characters on the page. They are a rendering of lines and bezier curves that represent the shapes of letters and numbers that you’d see on the page. From an object perspective, there’s no actual correlation between the text on the page and what you see when you look at a PDF. When you see a table, your mind visually interprets it as a table. In a PDF, a table is just a sequence of objects, representing other objects, representing bytes on the page. The content in a PDF needs to be structured if you want to be able to extract text from the PDF When you need to interact with multimedia on a page, PDF includes something called annotations to the file. Annotations are objects that are layered over the content that provide interactivity. Objects that make up text, images, and annotations aren’t connected to each other. Instead, these objects relate to where they are in relation to the page. As objects are independent from one another, they only describe what the page looked like before it became a PDF. What tags do PDFs are essentially an organized mess. Letters, numbers, and spaces aren’t automatically connected to themselves or to the graphics they sit next to. Any hyperlinks on the page are only clickable rectangles that float willy-nilly above the content. You can actually move these clickable rectangles separately from the URLs that happen to be underneath them. For content to make any kind of sense, you must define the relationships between these objects. You do that by giving a PDF what’s called a logical structure. The logical structure ranks groups of objects on the page. Objects receive attributes that provide further define their meaning. The logical structure lets you organize objects independently from the chaos of the PDF content. Under the hood, logical structure adds operands around the tokens in the content streams. Operands give special instructions to the tokens to provide undefined semantics. To define tokens, tags must be included along with the logical structure. Tags are a set of instructions for PDF Objects that provide meaning and purpose within the logical structure. Tags can be organized by adding them to the “structure tree,” also known as a “tag tree.” This contains the logical structure of a PDF. The tag tree has a root, where all structure begins from. Inside this root is the first child and subsequent grouped structure elements, represented by tags. That first child generally describes the type of document that’s being structured. The first child of most PDFs will be a <Document> tag explaining that the PDF is, well, a document. Consider a simplified example: Suppose that you were to add a tag root to the PDF in Acrobat. At this point, there’d be no actual tags associated with the document yet. In the PDF’s source code, all PDF objects now have a bunch of operands, or markers, assigned to them. These markers expose every single object in the PDF, regardless of how useful this information is. In order to provide a semantic relationship between what’s important and what’s not, we associate tags to the content. This separates real content from the content used to construct the page. For the parts of the document that are not important to understand the meaning of the content, we add a special designation. That designation is called an artifact. The PDF specification — ISO 32000— defines how certain content types need to be marked up. For example, hyperlinks must be tagged to associate the hyperlink to both the clickable rectangle and to the text or image that needs to be associated to it. The PDF specification explains the requirements about how to use specific tags. But it doesn’t always require you to use specific tags when associating content. For example, a PowerPoint presentation that’s exported to a PDF will represent its slides as containers. No matter what layout you use for your slides, each slide within that PDF will contain a first-level heading and a slew of paragraphs, even if the slide itself were to have the appearance of a bulleted list. In other words, there’s no requirement that stipulates something that says that elements within a PDF must be of the type that they look like. “Tagged PDF” vs Accessible PDF ISO 32000 doesn’t include a requirement for software to create PDFs as Tagged PDFs. It only requires software that supports Tagged PDFs to adhere to the chapter in ISO 32000 that covers Tagged PDF. Further, making a Tagged PDF does not necessarily render it accessible. Making PDFs work with assistive technologies (AT) was a bit of an afterthought. Tagged PDF was initially used to export to other formats like HTML or XML. The requirements for Tagged PDF leaves much to interpretation. That means that software companies can determine which tags they want to include when exporting to a PDF. Worse, there’s no consensus for which tags matter most to AT. What we’ve ended up with is a bunch of PDFs that could have provided more semantic information to AT. But AT tends to ignore information that they don’t recognize because it conflicts with its own interpretation. It has basically boiled down to some really poor communication between developers and assistive technology companies in the past. Not a solution, but a step in the right direction PDF/UA was released to try to resolve this miscommunication. PDF/UA makes requirements for both software that creates Tagged PDF and the AT that reads them. Yet, believe it or not, making a PDF file PDF/UA does not actually render a PDF accessible. PDF/UA is what we call a companion standard. A companion standard is a standard that’s used alongside other standards. PDF/UA defines requirements for software that creates tagged PDFs and for the assistive technologies that reads them. But saving a PDF file as a PDF/UA doesn’t automatically make the PDF accessible. PDF/UA primarily deals with making programmatically determined PDFs. PDF/UA places the responsibility for the content’s accessibility on the author. To make a PDF accessible, the document must be able to do a few things:  The content that matters needs to be separate from the content that doesn’t; Content needs to be organized to reflect the visual representation; Relevant stuff needs to make enough sense to to someone who isn’t looking at it; It needs to follow the rules of ISO 32000; Something needs to tell Assistive Technologies what it expect when reading it.  Putting it all together When you create a PDF, the file format creates a vector reproduction of the file’s visual presentation. To convey the presentation to other technology, the PDF must include some logic to define what’s what. Tagging a PDF does that. When assistive technologies accesses Tagged PDF, it needs to understand what’s going on in the document. It uses something called a Document Object Model or DOM to understand it. In PDF, the DOM is the structure tree. The authoring software decides the tags that are assigned to the PDF objects. The assignment of tags to objects can (and usually must be) fine-tuned by an end user. Unfortunately, one person’s interpretation of how to tag a document can be different from someone else’s. We agree to a common interpretation by following standards. Standards represent an agreement on how to structure content. PDF/UA specification helps to define a common set of semantics for PDF. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines provide guidance on how to describe content. Combined, those can go a long way toward helping you use the most semantic approach when you provide structure and meaning to PDFs. In my next article, I’ll be covering how using PDF/UA and WCAG together will help to provide better accessibility for PDFs.

Announcing a new podcast focused on accessible user experience  Posted on Thursday, 6 March 2014 by Sarah Horton  Category: Strategy   TPG is co-sponsor with Rosenfeld Media, UIE, and O’Reilly of a new podcast focused on advancing accessibility awareness and skills in the user experience profession: A Podcast for Everyone: Practical conversations answering your questions about how to make web sites and mobile apps work for everyone The podcast is a companion to the book, A Web for Everyone: Designing Accessible User Experiences. Whitney Quesenbery and I co-authored the book, and it features interviews with two other TPGers: our founder, Mike Paciello, and one of our Distinguished Accessibility Engineers, Steve Faulkner. Whitney and I really like to talk to people. The accessibility community is generous, and we have learned so much from people who took the time to share their knowledge and perspectives with us. We feature some of those discussions as interviews in the book. Once the book was done we really wanted to keep talking to people and sharing those great discussions. Our publisher, Lou Rosenfeld, suggested that we try a podcast, to keep the conversation going. With the support of  Lou, Mike, and our colleagues at UIE and O’Reilly, we pushed forward with creating A Podcast for Everyone. A special shoutout goes to Adam Churchill and  Sean Carmichael at UIE and Karen Corbett at Rosenfeld Media for helping us pull it all together. In the first episode, Whitney and I chat with Adam about the book and introduce the podcast. In future episodes, we will be the ones asking the questions. We have lots of people we want to talk to and topics we want to cover. And we welcome your ideas as well—email us at awebforeveryone@gmail.com and follow us at @awebforeveryone.

LieÂ states, “Opera has filed a formal complaint with the European Commission to force Microsoft to support open Web standards in its Web browser, Internet Explorer. We believe that Microsoft has harmed Web standards by refusing to support them; Microsoft often participates in creating Web standards, promoting them, and even promising to implement them. Despite their talent, however, they refuse to support Web standards correctly.” Wow! I think all of us in the accessibility world know the importance of harmonized web standards. Let’s hope that Microsoft steps up to the plate and does the right thing. A number of interesting tools have been released recently. Andrew Kirkpatrick announced a new Flash player for Firefox that includes upgraded support for captions. IBM, through the Eclipse Accessibility Tools Framework initiative announced the release of AccProbe, designed to give developers MSAA and IA2 application properties. While this isn’t new, I think it’s important for accessibility developers to continue supporting the Mac accessibility community. Along those lines, TPG’s Cedric Trevisan released a color contrast tool for the Mac platform. At heart, I’m a usability professional. So it’s not surprising that I enjoyed the December 2007 issue ofÂ Computer Power User magazine and their interview of plainÂ language icon Ginny Reddish. Do yourself a favor and download the article from the CPU web site (you’ll need to log in as a guest). Earlier this week Judy Brewer announced the final call for the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, Version 2.0. Many of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines harmonize with the TEITAC provisions for web site and web application accessibility. The review period concludes on June 22, 2008.  Section 508 Refresh (Part 1)  Posted on Thursday, 19 January 2017 by Matt Feldman  Category: NewsCategory: Standards Tag: 508Tag: Section 508Tag: WCAG   Over 8 years ago the US Access Board received a final report from an advisory committee focused on refreshing the accessibility requirements for Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This was commonly referred to as the “Section 508 Refresh”. Today we can finally call this important milestone complete and look forward to process and innovation in the field of accessibility. Background In 1998 the U.S. Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to require Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to people with disabilities. This amendment is known as Section 508. This law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic information technology. EIT applies to a broad range of categories and products including: telephones, computers, kiosks, web sites, applications, multimedia, office equipment and electronic documents. At its core, the law requires agencies to ensure employees with disabilities and members of the public have equivalent access to content and systems as we enter a digital age. Section 508 addresses both legal compliance through incorporation with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as well as technical compliance thanks to standards developed by the United States Access Board, also referred to as the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. These standards were approved and enforceable as of 2001. The authoring of these technical standards was a significant undertaking, but critical to the success and impact of this law. It not only established an industry standard for vendors and agencies, but more importantly, impacted the quality of life for hundreds of millions. Refresh History Anyone that has recently purchased a cell phone can attest that technology advances at an unbelievable pace. Within a few weeks of purchase there is already something faster, smaller and more advanced available on the market. To put things into perspective, in 2001 the smartphone was still in development. Today over one billion smartphones are used worldwide and have become a fundamental device in our daily lives. When the Access Board published its technical standards, they were grouped into six broad product categories, each with unique requirements.  Software applications and operating systems Web based information and applications Telecommunications products Video and multimedia products Self contained, closed products Desktop and portable computers  In combination, EIT was also required to comply with functional performance criteria and requirements for information, documentation and support. This approach was taken in part to simplify the process of determining what standards applied to a product being procured or developed. It was very effective early on, but the gaps quickly came into focus as technology evolved. Which brings us back to the smartphone. What category would a smartphone fit into? The answer is — many. It’s not only a portable computer, but also includes an operating system and telecommunication capabilities. Within a few years, many were already calling for a refresh of these standards to better align with the quickly evolving IT landscape. In 2006, the refresh process was initiated with the establishment of an advisory committee named TEITAC – Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory Committee. To reflect a balanced perspective, this committee was comprised of representatives from industry, disability groups, government agencies, foreign countries, and other stakeholders. TEITAC was tasked with developing a report that would influence the Access Board’s responsibility to refresh Section 508 and its guidelines. The focus of the report included research on types of products, barriers for individuals with disabilities, solutions to these barriers, recommendations on harmonization with international standards, and content for the revised guidelines and standards. The final report from this advisory committee was delivered on April 3, 2008. [Long Pause] Over 8 years later, after numerous drafts, revised drafts and periods of public comment, we finally have an approved final rule. On January 9th the Access Board released a final rule that updates accessibility requirements covered by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 along with guidelines for telecommunications equipment subject to Section 255 of the Communications Act of 1934. This joint release is intended to ensure that information and communications technology (ICT) covered by each statute be accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. The revised standards and guidelines were published in the Federal Register on January 18, 2017. Key Changes Function-Based Approach The original technical standards were organized by product type. This organization resulted in frustration and confusion as products evolved and new technology emerged overlapped these categories. A function-based approach was established to minimize confusion. Instead of basing requirements on “what it is,” the emphasis shifts to “what it does.” This improves the ease and accuracy of defining requirements and safeguards the language as technology evolves. Delayed Compliance Date Earlier revision of the rule defined a six-month compliance requirement after publication in the FAR. This has been extended to one year, which means agencies and vendors are not required to comply until January 18, 2018. This change will be met with mixed reviews from many federal agencies that have already begun incorporating some standards/guidelines into their respective programs and policies. Safe Harbor Provision When the new Section 508 guidelines take effect, products that comply with the standards published in 2001 and do not include “substantive changes” will not be required to meet the new standards. See specific language for this provision below: E202.2 Any component or portion of existing ICT that complies with an earlier standard issued pursuant to section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and that has not been altered on or after January 18, 2018 shall not be required to be modified to conform to the revised 508 standards. The Access Board has committed to providing extensive technical assistance to ensure this new provision is understood and applied appropriately. Functional Performance Criteria Modified Functional Performance Criteria was an important sub-part in the original amendment and will always be relevant even as technology evolves. These criteria include provisions that address the accessibility needs of various disability groups including people who are blind, low-vision, deaf, hard of hearing, without speech, and have mobility impairments. Missing from the original list are users with cognitive disabilities, such as dyslexia. A list of cognitive disabilities has been added along with modifications to the language to align with best practice application and harmonization with standards like EN 301549 – the European standard. This is only new to Section 508, as this was already addressed in Section 255. WCAG 2.0 Incorporated by Reference Perhaps the most significant and anticipated revision is the incorporation of WCAG 2.0 by reference. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are published by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international standards organization for the Internet. They are a set of guidelines that specify how to make content accessible, primarily for people with disabilities, but also for all user agents. The current version, WCAG 2.0, was published in December 2008. WCAG includes 3 levels of conformance: A, AA, AAA. These levels correspond to a combination of how essential, how effective, and how achievable each is, with AAA often being the most complex to meet. The Section 508 revised language only incorporates Level A and Level AA success criteria. Another important clarification is the application of WCAG. As the title suggests, these guidelines were written with “web” content in mind. However, many of these requirements can also be applied to non-web content like software and documents. This same approach is used internationally with the most prominent example being the European Standard. This harmonization is an important step forward as agencies and vendors can focus on one set of common requirements. Milestones  July 6, 2006 – Access Board named TEITAC members April 3, 2008 – Advisory committee presented report February 23, 2014 – Proposed rule submitted to OMB September 14, 2016 – Access Board approved final rule January 9, 2017 – Final Rule published January 18, 2017 – ICT Requirements published in FAR March 20, 2017 – Final rule effective January 18, 2018 – Delayed compliance date  What is Next These revised guidelines will also benefit from additional technical documentation and training. The Access Board will be working with a variety of federal agencies and partners to develop these materials. Members of the Access Board will provide a more detailed review of the ICT final rule on February 2, 2017. You can sign up for this webinar online. Check back soon!

Accessibility Scotland 2017  Posted on Tuesday, 24 October 2017 by David Swallow  Category: Conferences    The second Accessibility Scotland conference took place in Edinburgh on September 22nd. Accessibility Scotland was started up in 2016 by a group of local accessibility advocates—Kevin White, Wojtek Kutyla, Peter Heery, and TPG’s David Sloan—as an annual gathering where people could get together to chat about accessibility and inclusive design in an informal setting. For 2017, we had a change of venue, an exciting line-up of speakers, more coffee than last year, and what turned out to be a full house. The result was a great atmosphere and a series of excellent talks. Kicking off proceedings was Graham Pullin, senior lecturer at the University of Dundee and former senior designer at IDEO. Graham gave an inspirational talk about diversity and inclusion in design, citing a diverse range of research projects in which he has been involved, including Social Sewing, the Inclusive Fashion and Design Collective, and the Prayer Companion. Despite narrowing the scope of design to a specific user group, or even to a specific user, Graham emphasised how each project encouraged a broader, more open-minded perspective on inclusive design. Accessibility in the physical world inspired the next talk by Kiki MacDonald and Paul Ralph, who described the development of Euan’s Guide, a disabled access review website, dubbed “TripAdvisor for disabled people”. Kiki’s brother, Euan, is a powerchair user. Motivated by his difficulty in finding accessible venues, the two of them created the website, which currently hosts over 6,000 reviews of venues across the UK and beyond. Paul, who is a member of the Euan’s Guide team and a powerchair user himself, gave an entertaining and insightful account of technology’s empowering role in facilitating inclusive and independent living. Continuing the theme of the accessibility of physical places, Susan Fulton, a chartered surveyor with a Masters in Accessibility and Inclusive Design, talked about the ethos of inclusive design and what digital accessibility can learn from accessibility in the built environment. From ticket machines to accessible toilets, Susan drew upon a range of examples that highlight the importance of designing both our physical and digital with disabled people in mind. After a stimulating open conversation session, in which delegates split into groups to discuss the hot topics in accessibility, Michael Crabb, a lecturer at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, introduced the concept of “accessible everyone”. This looks at the permanent, temporary and situational accessibility challenges faced by all members of society. Michael drew upon his diverse research interests, including computer-augmented board games and the dynamic subtitling of TV content, to demonstrate how accessibility adds to the overall user experience of products and services. Finally, inclusive designer, writer and TPG accessibility engineer, Heydon Pickering gave an entertaining explanation of why inclusive design is like cooking curry. Amidst a lively discussion about whether dogs can eat curry, why image carousels are like raisins in curries (hint: no one likes them), and the limited facial expressions of Masterchef’s Gregg Wallace, Heydon highlighted the value of user research and of respecting user needs. Stressing the importance of documentation, Heydon demonstrated Infusion, the inclusive documentation builder he created to manage and document inclusive design patterns. Plans are already underway for 2018’s Accessibility Scotland—watch this space…  The TPG Voice  Posted on Tuesday, 20 November 2007 by Mike Paciello  Category: News   For well over a year, several members of the TPG team and I have been talking about setting up a company blog. The problem is, we have so many things going on, creating a focused blog is nearly impossible. Then again, is anything on the web focused? We agreed that we want to talk about accessibility of software, the Web, and emerging technology. We want to share our insights about tools, techniques, and usability. We’ll address laws, standards and guidelines. We will tell you about events, conferences, workshops, and initiatives. We have opinions, questions, complaints, ideas and gossip. Interesting gossip.Â And we love to learn — gosh, we love to learn.Â So you teach us. But here’s the key to this blog — it’s a team effort. No one personÂ is the sole or primary writer.Â Every member of the TPG team is passionate about accessibilityÂ and integral to our identity. Most (if not all!) of our team will contribute on one topic or another. We expect different topics to be discussed by different TPG team members each week.Â This is the TPG Voice…  When the refresh comes  Posted on Tuesday, 9 September 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   The Section 508 Refresh contains a provision that places responsibility on assistive technology vendors to make use of accessibility information made available via platform accessibility APIs. I suggest this is a very good thing.  Level playing field In our shared quest to provide user interfaces that are usable by all, accessibility practitioners (such as myself) have an expectation that developers (those who build the web) and browser vendors (those that provide access to the content of the web) will build their products according to agreed standards and guidelines. If they do not then their products will be unusable by some. None of the current standards relating to accessibility appear to place any responsibility on assistive technology vendors to ensure that their products use the agreed and implemented standards, I suggest that this is a very bad thing and does not serve users well. The Section 508 refresh includes a provision to remedy this imbalance of responsibility. We cannot continue to ask much of developers and browser vendors without assistive technology vendors doing their part. 503.3 Alternative User Interfaces. Where an application provides an alternative user interface that functions as assistive technology, the application shall use platform and other industry standard accessibility services to provide the alternate user interface. An example Developers code a control and label it, using a method initially defined  in HTML 4.1 (1999). i.e. it has been a conforming standard method for 15 years. They have done the right thing.  <label>email <input type=\"text\"></label> Browsers have implemented accessibility support for this method. The accessible name for the input element in the example is exposed by browsers via platform accessibility APIs. In testing conducted in 2012, all browsers that implemented accessibility support exposed the information correctly. They have done the right thing.  All of the assistive technology tested announced the correct label text. They have done the right thing. Buggy is buggy regardless of source – no free pass Browser vendors who do not implement standardized accessibility support and developers who do not code for accessibility are called out (regularly). Assistive technology vendors whose products do not convey information to users, provided using standardized coding patterns and exposed via standardized accessibility interfaces, are broken and must be fixed. They are doing the wrong thing.  Short note on Jaws keyboard layouts  Posted on Friday, 27 November 2015 by Léonie Watson  Category: Development   Jaws (screen reader) uses different keyboard commands for desktops and laptops. This is a short note to explain the difference and how to switch keyboard layout.  Jaws has different keyboard layouts because on desktops it makes heavy use of the numpad, whereas the numpad is typically not available on laptops. When you install Jaws the desktop keyboard layout is the default. You can change to the laptop keyboard layout in the startup wizard (Jaws > Help > Startup wizard), or by going to Jaws > Options > Basics > Keyboard layout. Web navigation remains unchanged with either keyboard layout, but basic text navigation changes, as does the key that acts as the Jaws modifier key. In desktop layout the modifier key is either insert or numpad 0. In laptop layout it is the capslock key. You hold it to use it as the Jaws modifier, and double tap it to toggle caps on/off. Instead of using the modifier key plus the numpad to navigate content by character, word, line etc. as you would on the desktop, you now use the modifier key plus letter keys. For example:  Modifier key + j: read previous word; Modifier key + k: read current word; Modifier key + l: read next word.  You can find all the keyboard commands for desktop and laptop by going to Jaws > Help > Help topics > Keystrokes, or online on the JAWS Keystrokes documentation page.  Pro HTML5 Accessibility – review  Posted on Wednesday, 27 June 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: News Tag: HTML   A new book Pro HTML5 Accessibility by  Joshue O’connor.  Likes The book is a valiant attempt at covering a voluminous, complex and fast changing subject area. The chapters I  liked (my area of interest) were those that make good primers to understanding AT and accessibility APIs:  Chapter 2: Understanding Disability and Assistive Technology Chapter 4 API and DOM  I also appreciated the overview Chapter 9:  HTML5, Usability and User-Centered Design, a subject area which is one of Joshue’s strong suits. Nits The static format of the printed book (and unfortunately the PDF copy links were not linked) does not lend itself to ease of access to the many valuable links to resources that are liberally sprinkled throughout the book. Chapters 11: WCAG 2.0 Client-Side Scripting Techniques and 12: Definition of WAI-ARIA Roles is information available online, and subject to change over time and therefore more appropriately accessed online. Conclusion Solid information on a complex subject area. If you buy it, get an ebook version to more easily access the feast of  pointers to online resources.

Accessibility APIs: A key to web accessibility on Smashing Magazine  Posted on Wednesday, 18 March 2015 by Léonie Watson  Category: News   I co-wrote an article with Chaals McCathie Nevile for Smashing Magazine. The article explains the origins of the platform accessibility API, how it’s used by assistive technologies, and why semantic markup is such an important part of accessible interface design.   How do assistive technologies present a web application to make it accessible for their users? Where do they get the information they need? One of the keys is a technology known as the accessibility API (or accessibility application programming interface, to use its full formal title). Accessibility APIs: A key to web accessibility   Making Twitter Tweet – Using the TPG Notifier  Posted on Friday, 9 May 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: ARIATag: HTML   As part of my presentation at the Accessibility 2.0 Conference I demonstrated a preferences module conceived by Hans Hillen, Gez Lemon and I, as a proof of concept(s) for ways to provide cues to users allowing them to benefit from and/or have access to content that changes dynamically without a page refresh. This was presented using the Twitter character countdown feature, which indicates to users the number of characters (140 character limit) they have left to type into a textarea. The TPG notifier includes 3 methods to inform a user of how many letters they have left to type in a text area, before the limit is reached. The 3 methods:  JavaScript alert Flash aural cues WAI-ARIA Live regions  Each method has its pros and cons:  The JavaScript alert requires that focus be moved away from the text area to the alert box and the user to press the ‘OK’ button for the focus to be moved back to its previous position in the text area. But this method is probably the most widely supported across browsers and Assistive Technology. The Flash method involves the use of reasonably complex JavaScript and the production of the aural cue files. But is well supported and does not require the AT to support Flash, only that the Browser has the Flash plugin installed. The WAI-ARIA live region method is easily implemented, but currently has limited support.  As previously stated this is a ‘proof of concept’ and has not been tested with assistive technology users. The most important aspect is that it provides Preferences, which a user can enable if they choose to. So users are not forced to use any method if they don’t find them useful. Demonstration Have a look at the working example or download the example sourcecode (zip file). The example has WAI-ARIA live regions, with a visual fade indicator, set as default. If live regions are unsupported by a user’s browser or Assistive Technology, they can choose from the other methods available. Technical Details Hans Hillen took on the task of developing the concept (thanks Hans!) and provides information on the technical details: The TPG notifier can be created as a javascript object by a developer for any specific page. It uses unobtrusive scripting, but does not fall back on a non scripted alternative. User agents that do not support javascript simply will not receive the updates. The notifier object allows developers to create different notifications, which can then be sent to the user at any suitable event. Currently there are three different notification types: Auditory Icons (using Adobe Flash), browser alerts, and live regions. The key factor is that the end user can decide which method to use, based on his or her preference and level of support. The Notifier class is easy to extend, allowing additional notification alternatives to be added in the future. For now, let’s have a closer look at the available methods: Audio Updates Using Adobe Flash With this approach, we use Flash to play back sound as a result of a particular event. The Flash movie is a 5kb file that does not contain any actual visual content, only scripted behaviour that handles the loading and playback of sound files. This approach does not require the user to interact with the flash movie at all, as this is all handled by JavaScript. To prevent users from being hassled with messages about missing plugins or plugin versions, we have used the swfobject 2.0 method (developed by Bobby van der Sluis). Swfobject makes it easy to inject Flash content to a document in an unobtrusive, cross browser friendly way. This approach also makes use of the TPG notifier a lot easier, as the developer does not have to worry about manually implementing flash objects on every page, the TPG notifier takes care of this. Also, when a user agent is not capable of playing Flash content, this method will degrade gracefully without bothering the end users about missing plugins. Since the notifier has different notification methods next to Flash, supporting Flash is not crucial. The Notifier object will switch the notification method to something that does not require a plugin (currently it will switch to the ‘live region’ method). The sound files have be in mp3 format. These can be simple and short sound files (such as a beep) , speech recordings, or anything that’s appropriate. Also, different types of alerts can be created using the same sound file, by manipulating volume, spacial position and repetition. For example, the demo provided with this article generates three alerts, based on the remaining number of characters left in a text area. Using the preferences section you can choose to either use a different sound for each event, or to use the same sound but louder for each event. Have a look at the preferences section of the demo to get an idea of the possibilities. Using JavaScript alerts A method that is more natively supported by most browsers is the use of browser alerts (e.g. window.alert() calls). The main disadvantage of this approach is that it is disruptive to the user’s browsing experience. For this reason, this method should never be a default setting when using the notifier. It should only be used when chosen by the user. Next to the wide level of support, there is another advantage for this approach: the fact that the alert box is modal and always draws focus to itself provides a guarantee that the user will perceive the notification. Also, even though it steals focus, it always places it back to where it was. Using ARIA Live Regions ARIA Live regions are ideal for notifying users of changed content. The TPG notifier can be used to either create a new live region from scratch to place the notification text in, or an existing element can be targeted to function as a live region. The notifier also takes a set of parameters that determine how the live region will be created. For your visitors to try this method out, they will need a browser that supports live regions (such as Mozilla Firefox ), as well as compatible assistive technology (such as Firevox, NVDA or ORCA). To Implement The Notifier requires a few files to be present in your site structure (and the javascript files will have to be loaded in this order:  swfobject.js, which contains the swfobject code responsible for injecting flash into the page. TPG/Utilities.js, which contains core functions used by the notifier. TPG/Notifier.js, which contains the actual notifier related classes. TPG/tpgnotifier.swf, which is the actual flash file responsible for loading and playing the sounds. The functionality is is located in the SoundHander.as file. Additionally MP3 files will have to be provided by the developer.  In short, these are the steps that have to be undertaken to implement the TPG notifier in your page:  Create a new instance of the TPG.Notifier class. The constructor takes two parameters: the method to use, and an optional object that can be used to pass configuration parameters to the notifier. Since the user has to be able to choose the preferred method, this variable should be provided through a persistent preference (such as a cookie). Load the actual notifications. Regardless of the method, a notification always requires a text message to be specified. The reason is that a chosen non-text method (such as Flash) is not supported, it can fall back to a text based alternative. For Flash Notifications, create a new sound object and add it to the notification created in the previous step. You don’t have to create a new sound object for every notification. You can also reuse the same sound in a unique way by changing its parameters. Whenever an event occurs that should notify the user, fire the notification. The notifier will handle which method to use.:  The basic code sample below shows a basic version of the function calls required to set up a notification involving Flash sound: //1. create notifier object. The \\'method\\' parameter should be retrieved from a user preference tpgNotifier = new TPG.Notifier(method, Params); //2. Add a new notification, specifying its text message and ID which we will use for referencing tpgNotifier.addNotification(\"30 characters left\", \"alert1\"); //3. create a new sound object, and add the resulting ID to the notifier we created in step 2 tpgNotifier.setNotificationSound(\"alert1\", tpgNotifier.createSound(\"myFile.mp3\")); //4. On appropriate event, fire the notification tpgNotifier.notify(\"alert1\"); Browser Support This method has currently been tested on Internet Explorer 6 and up, Opera 9, Firefox 2 and Safari for Windows. Safari seems to have some issues when running the notifier from a local web page. As mentioned above this is still a work in progress.

But the form that expertise takes and how it is delivered varies depending on different clients’ needs. Some look for high-level reports, while others prefer issues to be addressed independently, in the midst of ongoing development. As clients have gotten wise to the benefit of designing for accessibility from the ground up, the demand for our expertise at earlier stages of product lifecycles has increased. Accordingly, we’ve been investigating and developing new kinds of services and deliverables; ones more suited to design than design critique. One area that has been of particular interest has been pattern libraries. Often, design issues can only be effectively addressed by creating entirely new patterns and components to solve those problems. These solutions can be detailed in reports, or in working code. A good pattern library contains both working code and its documentation — all in the same place. To manage pattern libraries effectively, we needed a system for building and hosting them. This is why we built Cupper, and we’re happy to share it as a free and open tool with you. Documentation sites as PWAs Cupper is a high performance generator of rich and accessible documentation sites in the form of progressive web applications (PWAs). That means the documentation sites you create can be saved to your devices and read offline. Because Cupper instances exist as Github repositories, this is possible out of the box. When you commit and push changes to your content, your Github Pages site is updated and a new service worker is installed. Cupper Docs icon, pictured on an Android homescreen More than just markdown “Pattern” files in Cupper are written in markdown. Markdown is the preferred format of static site generators because, as a text format, it is easy to version control. But Cupper allows you to include much richer content in your markdown via special shortcodes. Included are shortcodes for expandable sections, file tree diagrams, WCAG references, browser support tables, and even working code demos encapsulated with Shadow DOM. These are all documented in Cupper’s own documentation site, which is built with Cupper. Accessibility dogfooding Cupper‘s name comes from the British slang for tea. The British Paciello Group contingent drink a lot of tea, as you might imagine, but tea also makes for an apt metaphor: If a standard pattern library is water, Cupper is its more palatable equivalent — a pattern library infused with accessible and inclusive design patterns. Regardless of what you are documenting using Cupper, the documentation you’ll be creating meets the highest accessibility standards and incorporates a wealth of inclusive design features. For example, you might use Cupper to document a JavaScript library you’ve written. You can be confident that people using the documentation by keyboard will be able to read long code examples. That’s because Cupper makes scrollable regions focusable by keyboard. Cupper sites are lightweight, responsive, readable, and clearly structured both visually and semantically. An anti-aesthetic Cupper‘s visual design is almost entirely black and white. In fact, the only time it breaks into greyscale is for code syntax highlighting. The sparse, neutral aesthetic was chosen so that the branding and visual design of subject content would not come into conflict. Should you find a darker design kinder to the eyes, Cupper also offers a white-on-black “dark mode”, available from the footer of any instance.  If you are interested in using Cupper, please be our guest and fork the repository before following the installation and setup instructions. Below are all the resources you’ll need:  The Cupper Github repository Cupper’s documentation, written with Cupper  note: Cupper was, in its so far brief life, formerly known as Infusion.

This is a personal loss for me because John was diagnosed with Leukemia the same year my wife Kim was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer.Â John was one of the first friends to contact me when Kim was diagnosed. When aÂ dearly loved spouse isÂ diagnosed with a terminal disease, anxiety is often high and long-term. It is a proverbial rollercoaster ride. Only someone of John’s character could truly understand what Kim and I were going through. I can only imagine how John’s wife Anna feels today. That is whyÂ I’m asking you to support this wonderfulÂ initiative launched by Sharon Rush (Knowability) and Andrew Kirkpatrick (Adobe) to help Anna. The project is called the John Slatin Fund Accessibility Project. Â The goal is to raise $25,000.00 USD to help Anna defray the medical costs. The beauty of this project is that we’re doing it John’s way — by helping other organizations enhance their web sites for accessibility. All of us at TPG are fully supportive of this wonderful project and have offered our time as a team. We encourage all our fellow colleagues to join us!  :focus-visible and backwards compatibility  Posted on Friday, 23 March 2018 by Patrick H. Lauke  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   Clearly visible focus styles are important for sighted keyboard users. However, these focus styles can often be undesirable when they are applied as a result of a mouse/pointer interaction. A classic example of this are buttons which trigger a particular action on a page, such as advancing a carousel. While it is important that a keyboard user is able to see when their focus is on the button, it can be confusing for a mouse user to find the look of the button change after they clicked it – making them wonder why the styles “stuck”, or if the state/functionality of the button has somehow changed. For this reason, modern browsers apply simple heuristics to determine whether or not to apply their default focus styling. In general, if an element received focus as a result of a mouse/pointer click, browsers will suppress their default focus indication. (Note: some browsers use more sophisticated heuristics; for instance, Firefox won’t suppress default focus styles, even as a result of a mouse click, if the user has previously used TAB / SHIFT+TAB to navigate through the page). When authors define explicit :focus styles, however, these browser heuristics are ignored. :focus styles are applied whenever the element receives focus, whether it was as a result of a keyboard or mouse/pointer interaction. To circumvent this issue, authors have had to resort to hacky “solutions”, generally involving JavaScript (such as the excellent What Input?). The recently proposed :focus-visible pseudo-class (a standardized version of Firefox’s -moz-focusring) aims to provide a standardised CSS-native solution to the problem. Instead of defining traditional :focus styles, authors would use :focus-visible, and browsers (using their built-in heuristics) would only apply those styles in the same situation as the default focus styles. Note that, at the time of writing, no browser has yet implemented :focus-visible (see canisue.com information on :focus-visible), but if you’re “future-friendly” and planning to already use this pseudo-class to reap its benefits when browser support does come, read along… As a basic example, let’s assume our current styles include the following: button:focus { /* some exciting button focus styles */ } This explicit :focus styling is currently applied whenever the button receives focus. In future, when browsers support :focus-visible, we’d instead have: button:focus-visible { /* some exciting button focus styles */ } While great in principle, authors won’t be able to simply replace :focus with :focus-visible, as that would break backwards compatibility and leave keyboard users with no explicit focus styling (other than whatever default the browser may still apply). Ideally then, we’d want to use :focus-visible only in browsers that support it. Unfortunately, as :focus-visible is a pseudo-class, we can’t use @supports, since feature queries don’t (currently?) support these as part of their conditions. But, even if they did, in order to cater to both non-supporting and supporting browsers, we’d essentially be defining :focus styles as normal, and then undoing those styles and replicating them again for :focus-visible. Workable, but not exactly elegant. /* this won\\'t actually work as @supports does not support pseudo-classes...\\r    but it demonstrates the less than elegant style acrobatics involved in\\r    setting and unsetting :focus styles */\\r \\r button:focus { /* some exciting button focus styles */ }\\r \\r @supports (:focus-visible) {\\r     button:focus { /* undo all the above focused button styles */ }\\r     button:focus-visible { /* and then reapply the styles here instead */ }\\r } We could resort to JavaScript to try and determine support for :focus-visible (for instance, see this discussion on StackOverflow on how to detect if browsers support a specified css pseudo-class) and then dynamically swap out style definitions or entire stylesheets … but this would seem to defeat the purpose of a clean CSS-native solution. The most viable (though still not particularly elegant) solution may be to use the :not() negation pseudo-class, and to (paradoxically) define styles not for :focus-visible, but to undo :focus styles when it is absent. button:focus { /* some exciting button focus styles */ }\\r button:focus:not(:focus-visible) {\\r     /* undo all the above focused button styles\\r        if the button has focus but the browser wouldn\\'t normally\\r        show default focus styles */\\r }\\r  Note that this works even in browsers that don’t support :focus-visible because although :not() supports pseudo-classes as part of its selector list, browsers will ignore the whole thing when using a pseudo-class they don’t understand/support, meaning the entire button:focus:not(:focus-visible) { ... } block is never applied. There’s arguably some advantage in using :focus-visible if we wanted to provide additional stronger styles for browsers that support it, as we could then assume that they would only apply in the case of keyboard focus (or, more accurately, in the case where the browser’s heuristics determined that visible focus indication was appropriate). But that would still mean that in older/unsupported browsers, we’d be knowingly providing a less-than-ideal experience. button:focus { /* some exciting button focus styles */ }\\r button:focus:not(:focus-visible) {\\r     /* undo all the above focused button styles\\r        if the button has focus but the browser wouldn\\'t normally\\r        show default focus styles */\\r }\\r button:focus-visible { /* some even *more* exciting button focus styles */ }\\r  So, what does all this boil down to? Once all browsers support :focus-visible, for situation where an indication of focus as a result of a mouse/pointer click is deemed undesirable, we’d be simply be using :focus-visible where previously we used :focus. However, to support any browsers that don’t implement the pseudo-class, we’ll either have to polyfill support for :focus-visible, or always use the less than elegant :not(:focus-visible) approach to essentially unset :focus styles in situations where the browser wouldn’t set its default visible focus indication either.  Considerations for making an accessible kiosk  Posted on Thursday, 16 November 2017 by Ryan Jones  Category: StandardsCategory: Webinars   Special thanks to Matt Feldman for his contributions. From airports and train stations to government offices, restaurants, grocery stores and retailers, the use of kiosk machines is widespread as a convenience for customers and an alternative to human service by the kiosk provider. Long gone are the days where an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) was the only form of kiosk a person might need to use. It is now commonplace to find common service functions are now performed through kiosk solutions. As the use of kiosks grows, so does the need to ensure they are accessible and usable for all people, including those with disabilities. The application of accessibility standards to kiosk machines While there is no universal set of standards that provide specific guidance around making kiosks accessible, there are standards that may be useful. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 standards provide direction in making web content accessible. These standards will be most applicable when the kiosk interface is presented in an HTML or web-based format. For example, a bank kiosk may allow customers to access account information from their online banking portal or a hotel might provide a kiosk to allow a customer to manage their stay or account information. In addition, the U.S. government Section 508 standards may also be used to guide interface development. Specifically, these standards may apply to government related kiosk machines. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) contains standards for physical design considerations that may be useful in determining the physical requirements of a kiosk machine. In addition to the broadly applied standards such as WCAG 2.0 and the ADA, specific industries may adopt or create specific standards unique to their environment. For example, the U.S. Department of Transportation created the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) which provides requirements around the accessibility of airline industry technologies. The ACAA identifies specific standards on how and when their kiosks should be made accessible. Other industries may wish to use standards such as the ACAA as a starting place when developing their own regulations or standards. Most Kiosks are considered stand alone or closed system, meaning users won’t have the flexibility to use personal assistive technology to access or interact with content or elements. This requires vendors to consider the needs of individual with varying abilities. Unlike WCAG and Section 508, which provide precise guidelines and technical specifications related to accessibility, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) has taken a different approach with performance based objectives, more like the functional requirements in Section 508. These objectives ensure a wide variety of user needs are built into these closed systems. CVAA Performance Objectives § 14.21 Performance Objectives (read the full section at the Legal Information Institute)  Generally – Manufacturers and service providers shall ensure that equipment and services covered by this part are accessible, usable, and compatible as those terms are defined in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Accessible – The term accessible shall mean that:  Input, control, and mechanical functions shall be locatable, identifiable, and operable in accordance with each of the following, assessed independently:  Operable without vision. Provide at least one mode that does not require user vision. Operable with low vision and limited or no hearing. Provide at least one mode that permits operation by users with visual acuity between 20/70 and 20/200, without relying on audio output. Operable with little or no color perception. Provide at least one mode that does not require user color perception. Operable without hearing. Provide at least one mode that does not require user auditory perception. Operable with limited manual dexterity. Provide at least one mode that does not require user fine motor control or simultaneous actions. Operable with limited reach and strength. Provide at least one mode that is operable with user limited reach and strength. Operable with a Prosthetic Device. Controls shall be operable without requiring body contact or close body proximity. Operable without time dependent controls. Provide at least one mode that does not require a response time or allows response time to be by passed or adjusted by the user over a wide range. Operable without speech. Provide at least one mode that does not require user speech. Operable with limited cognitive skills. Provide at least one mode that minimizes the cognitive, memory, language, and learning skills required of the user.      Considerations when making kiosks accessible The following considerations are broadly useful when incorporating accessibility into kiosk. Physical design  Are all controls on the kiosk tactilely distinguishable? For example, is it possible to identify the audio headphone jack by touch or by a tactile symbol? Do controls have braille or large print labels? While putting braille labels on all keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard may not be necessary, it may be important to label special function keys or controls that are not standard on a traditional keyboard. Is the height and spacing of the screen and controls appropriate for different types of users? An individual in a wheel chair may be viewing the screen from a lower angle than someone who is standing up. Is there sufficient physical clearance around the machine for users with assistive mobility devices? A person in a wheelchair, scooter, or other mobility device may need more room to maneuver when approaching or leaving the machine.  Interface design  What types of controls are needed to use the interface? For example, is a physical keyboard needed along with a touch screen in order for someone to enter text? Should a mouse, track ball, or touch pad device be present if a pointer is needed to use the interface? A person with a motor skills challenge may find it difficult to move their hand around a touch screen but may have no trouble using a track ball or touch pad pointer. Can the visual presentation of the interface be customized? For example, can someone with a visual impairment zoom in or out to change the size of the onscreen font? Can someone who is color blind determine the functionality of controls by a method other than color alone? Does the interface provide speech output? For someone who is blind or low vision, speech output (text-to-speech) may be the only way they can interact with the device. Does the text-to-speech function activate when headphones are inserted into the jack? If not, is there a clearly communicated way such as a braille sign for the user to know how to activate the text-to-speech function? Does the interface reset to a standard configuration after each person uses it? The interface should always return to a default state after each user completes their tasks.  Conclusion In addition to the considerations listed above, it is important to ensure that the kiosk design is tested by people with various types of disabilities. This may include testing at various stages during the design and development process but at a minimum, user testing should be done once the design is complete. In addition, it will also be important to ensure that staff who may assist people using the kiosk understand what accessibility features are present and how to help someone use them. An accessibility feature is only as good as a person’s ability to use it and their knowledge that it exists in the first place. Staff may also wish to periodically test the accessibility features to verify they are always working as expected. An accessible and well-designed kiosk machine can provide an efficient and independent experience for all users. As with all things related to accessibility, it is important to consider an accessible design from the very beginning. It is generally much more costly and inefficient to add accessibility after a product has been developed or is already in use.

Update on the Section 508 / Section 255 Guidelines  Posted on Friday, 26 February 2010 by Mike Paciello  Category: Strategy   I thought I’d clear up any potential confusion over the recent rumor that the revised version of the Section 508 and Section 255 guidelines would be published for public comment in March. Last night I confirmed with the US Access Board that the version of the guidelines to be released in March are an “Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)”, with a 90-day period for public comment. It is important to note that this Advance Notice is a step BEFORE a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM). The Advance Notice is being provided in the interest of getting material out to the public in a timely manner. This Advance Notice allows draft text to be released. After public comments are received and reviewed, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking will then be released, after preparation of a regulatory assessment, as well as a full Preamble. The date of the NPRM is not known at this time. An official notice will appear in the US Federal Register when draft text is available. Note that the US Access Board will be holding a special session at this year’s CSUN conference in San Diego. Members of the public will be invited to speak during the event. Everyone is encouraged to attend. You can find CSUN on Facebook.  Inclusive Design posters from Barclays  Posted on Tuesday, 15 August 2017 by Henny Swan  Category: UX   Our friends at Barclays have designed some beautiful posters of the Inclusive Design Principles shared under Creative Commons. We thought we’d ask David Caldwell, Digital Accessibility Manager at Barclays, to share with us how they are using the principles in-house. Before I hand over to David I’d like to say a huge thank you to you and your team for the posters and your insights.  I’m really pleased to have been asked to write a guest blog for the Paciello Group and even more pleased that it’s on the topic of the Inclusive Design Principles.  Before I launch into telling you about how we’re using the Inclusive Design Principles, I should probably let you know who I am. I’m David Caldwell, I’m a Digital Accessibility Manager at Barclays where I work across a wide range of different pieces of work the biggest of which is currently our training and development programme for accessibility called The Accessibility Academy. For those of you who don’t know who Barclays are we’re a transatlantic consumer, corporate and investment bank with a strong presence in our two home markets of the UK and the US. Our global purpose is to help people achieve their ambitions which is particularly pertinent for our work in the accessibility agenda. For the agenda we also have an ambition to become the most accessible and inclusive company in the FTSE 100- an ambition that’s grown over time and which we use as a call to arms for our colleagues, suppliers and partners. One of the biggest challenges we face as a global organisation is delivering a consistently accessible and inclusive experience to all of our customers and clients regardless of whether they’re opening their first bank account, looking to buy their first homes, a sports fan wanting to get cashback on their ticket purchases or a multi-national looking for a cash management platform. With over 60 million customers we’re always going to have a need for accessible and inclusively designed digital solutions but with globally and organisationally dispersed teams it’s always going to be tough to make sure we give everyone the best experience. Over the years we’ve tried lots of different approaches to help build knowledge and understanding with varying degrees of success. Last year we created a simple to use infographic highlighting the POUR principles of accessibility and we’ve been leveraging ideas and concepts from the likes of IBM and Microsoft on broadening the scope of accessibility to be more about inclusive design. That’s why when we saw that The Paciello Group had created a new set of Inclusive Design Principles we jumped at the chance to take the amazing content they’d created and add our own Barclays twist. Working with our Designers we’ve created two sets of posters:  An A3 poster with a summary of the 7 principles A set of A4 posters which provide a more detailed view of each of the principles.  The hope is that we’ll start to encourage designers and developers to think more inclusively when they create new products and services. We’re now exploring new ways of sharing the posters with our teams here at Barclays including hosting a webinar with Henny on the topic of Inclusive Design, using the posters as part of the Accessibility Academy and signposting them through newsletters, intranet articles and blogs. We’re also really keen to get them out into the hands of as many people outside of Barclays too. One of the core principles our Digital Accessibility Team work to is open sourcing and sharing as much as we can and that’s why I’m proud that we’ve released the posters to the world with a Creative Commons licence. This means that anyone can not only use the posters but can take what we’ve done and build on it. We’re really pleased with the response we’ve seen so far through our initial launch with The Paciello Group and we’re currently working with other partners such as The Business Disability Forum to launch them more widely. Last year, as part of our open sourcing and sharing approach, we launched the Barclays Corporate Accessibility Portal. Created by our colleagues in our Corporate Bank and in partnership with some of our Corporate customers, the portal brings together best practice resources-  some which we’ve created and some which we just love. The principles are available on the site along with other resources we’ve created including the POUR infographic (PDF), our diverse personas (PDF) and our Let’s Talk Accessibility and Accessibility Myths animations. We’d love to hear your feedback on what you think about the designs as well as how you’re using them. Get in touch via @BarclaysAccess and look out for more resources coming later this year! A full explanation of each principle can be found on the Inclusive Design Principles site or in the related blog posts below:  Provide a comparable experience Consider situation Be consistent Give control Offer choice Prioritise content Add value   WebABLE.TV Official WebCaster for CSUN 2014 Conference  Posted on Sunday, 2 March 2014 by Mike Paciello  Category: Strategy   The CSUN conference is again working with WebAble TV, an Internet TV channel for people with disabilities on the TV Worldwide Network, in partnership with The Paciello Group (TPG), to be the Official Webcaster for CSUN 2014 .

TPG Partners With Deque to Expand Accessibility Services  Posted on Tuesday, 22 March 2011 by Mike Paciello  Category: Strategy   As many of you know, at The Paciello Group we are passionate advocates for the practice of manual testing of applications and websites to ensure accessibility. Using quality assurance and usability test processes issues are properly identified and subsequently enhanced to optimize the user experience.  We have built a world-renowned consultancy, delivering superior value to our clients.  A key challenge involving manual testing is scalability.  It is impractically labor intensive and expensive to test every corner of every application.  For our enterprise clients that deploy large-scale software applications or highly complex, dynamic websites, we have been looking for an automated solution that, when combined with our expertise, scales to meet their unique demands. We are pleased to announce a partnership with Deque Systems, makers of the Worldspace Suite. The Offering TPG and Deque are making a combined offering to address the challenge of enterprise-wide compliance. Neither automated testing nor manual testing, utilized independently can deliver the complete solution required. TPG and Deque are uniquely qualified as partners to offer both expert consulting and Worldspace to customers, delivering the best total solution available in the accessibility marketplace today. To support Worldspace implementations, TPG is delivering a package of consultancy services, including:  Accessibility audits that include in-depth analysis reports and can be combined with automated test data that provide a full picture of compliance, as well as customized Worldspace tests based on the issues found. Customized, manual testing scripts for verification of Worldspace results and otherwise cover areas not tested automatically. A training package that combines usage of Worldspace and other Deque tools with the manual testing required to round out the process.  TPG is proud and excited to be launching this partnership! For additional information, please contact TPG’s Director of Marketing and Sales, Brian Landrigan at: 603-882-4122 extension 102  for additional information. The Partners The Paciello Group (TPG) is an accessibility consultancy in operation since 2001. TPG provides a range of services including strategy development, auditing, reporting and training to a variety of blue chip clients.  We have an international presence and deliver a high level of expertise. The TPG consultancy team is composed of experienced developers who can deliver code-level solutions and who also take part in the global accessibility effort through online discussion and participation in standards bodies. Deque Systems has been building accessibility tools since 2001. They have developed the market leading end-to-end automated testing solution, the Worldspace Suite, that includes reporting and dashboard features essential to a mature and complete accessibility program as well as support for manual developer testing of web applications and web sites.

Colour deficit help  Posted on Friday, 16 March 2018 by Matthew Atkinson  Category: Development   This is the last in the current series of articles looking at adaptations for accessibility, based on new techniques or research. The last part discussed “invert brightness”. Many people in the world have some difficulty in perceiving colour. A very well-known condition is “red-green colour blindness” (there are actually two different sub-types of this, deuteranomaly and protanomaly), though there are several other types of colour deficit. Practical Steps The fundamental solution to this problem, which also helps people with no colour perception, is to not rely on colour alone to convey information—use position, size, shape and other visual characteristics (as well as a textual equivalent for people who cannot see). Some computer games offer settings to make things clearer for people with colour perception difficulties. Frozen Bubble, for example, involves matching bubbles of different colours. A range of colours are used and, whilst they are quite close to the primary colours, they could be hard to discern. There is an option to include prominent shapes within the bubbles, so that shape can be used as a differentiator too. Frozen bubble in “standard” mode with colours differentiating the bubbles Frozen bubble using shapes to help differentiate the bubbles More information on games and colour deficit can be found below. The use of shapes as well as colour is a great technique. GitHub uses shaped status indicators so that their colour isn’t the only thing that indicates success or failure. Coupled with a text alternative for the images, this is a robust accessibility technique that helps many users. Example HTML code that may be used for including images that are differentiated by colour and shape, and supply appropriate alt text <p>Status: <img src=\"green-tick.svg\" alt=\"Success\"></p>\\r <p>Status: <img src=\"red-cross.svg\" alt=\"Failure\"></p>   Providing two different ways of conveying the same information redundantly (be it colour and shape, or sight and sound) is proven to be beneficial to everyone’s perception. Great examples such as those above are to be lauded and will always be best practice. However, it would be great if there was more we could do to provide information to someone who can see colour, but just not all colours… Addressing the fundamental problem One of the main difficulties that people with these conditions have is that, due to their more limited spectrum of colour perception, they can miss out on important information that is innately apparent to other people who have good colour vision. One such example is the ability to identify different fruits that may be on sale on a market stall. Apples and oranges may look very different if you see colour well, but if not, from a distance they can be hard to distinguish. Colour provides a means to differentiate, and the lack of being able to do so causes a loss of information (that there are two different types of fruits on this stall), and thus presents an accessibility barrier. Some time ago I stumbled upon a brilliant solution to this problem. The approach taken was to solve the underlying problem—the lack of bandwidth to convey visual information—by considering the spectrum of colours that the user can see and differentiate and using only that to display images. Colours the user cannot distinguish are moved further apart, by increasing contrast between them, and variations in, e.g. red-green, are converted to other features such as variations in brightness or between other colours. A simplified way to think of it is to imagine the whole full-colour spectrum is effectively squeezed into the range of colours that a person with any particular type of colour defect can distinguish (plus other features such as brightness, to mitigate against any loss of information). Thinking of transforming a spectrum containing colours a person can’t see into one that uses only colours they can see Whilst someone with colour defect is unable to perceive, for example, green as others may know it, and maybe can’t tell apart some shades of red or green, this clever processing technique re-maps “red-green” to something the person is able to distinguish. The image doesn’t look how others would see it—it is expressed using a more limited pallet, but that’s the point: because it is using the more limited palette, it’s able to transfer more of its original information content to the user. You can find some examples and pictorial demonstrations of this on the VisCheck website. Current and future app and platform support A number of applications have been created over the years to simulate colour deficit, including Huetility (since removed from the app store) and Chromatic Vision Simulator. These are great for allowing people to experience what it’s like to have colour deficit, which raises awareness and allows designers to check that their designs will be accessible out of the box. It is also very helpful to have adaptations built into the platform/device to help users perceive content that is not immediately accessible and both Google and Apple provide such features (links below). It is great to see these adaptations being made readily available on platforms that so many people use.

Posted on Friday, 18 July 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Standards   I started to write a post about the new social accessibility tools/services that have been announced in the last week or so: IBM Social Accessibility Project and Webvisum. And another one that has been around for about 5 years: C-SAW (Community Supported Accessible Web) from Serotek. This service is bundled with an AT called System Access. Although it only appears to be available (there is a dearth of information about C-SAW) with this commercial product there are over 4000 sites tagged with extra information to enhance accessibility for System Access users. When it was first announced Serotek offered other AT companies such as Freedom Scientific (JAWS) and GW Micro (Window Eyes) the opportunity to provide the C-SAW service as an open standards along with their products, but the offer was rejected. Anyway, in the process of researching this post I found a post on Blind Confidential that covered all the aspects of the topic I wanted to talk about, and then some. So rather than duplicate information here I suggest that you read this post: Time For Cooperation Over the past week or so, I’ve seen two announcements proclaiming new technologies for community driven projects to label non-compliant web sites that work poorly with screen readers. Adding these to C-Saw from Serotek which has been around for years makes three systems that total to superfluous and counterproductive sectarian standards that should be harmonized as quickly as possible to provide the entire community with a unified database standard so, no matter the AT they choose, all will enjoy similar results…” Further Reading:  Interview with WebVisum.com – crowdsourced accessibility Sleeping Giants   Accessibility Testing Tools – updated  Posted on Sunday, 26 October 2014 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: Accessibility InspectorTag: aViewerTag: CCATag: WATTag: WCAG   Here at The Paciello Group (TPG) we have a technical accessibility testing process which does not involve the use of automated tools. The technical audit results we provide to our clients are based solely on manual testing of a web site, web application, mobile or desktop application.   Typically, but not solely, we conduct technical testing in reference to the following accessibility standards:  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (web sites and web applications and other ICT) Section 508 1194.21- Software Applications and Operating Systems (desktop applications and web applications) Section 508 1194.22 – Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications (web sites and web applications) Section 508 Refresh Standards  (Formal title: Draft Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Standards and Guidelines).  To aid us in our manual testing process we use a number of tools and assistive technologies, the following is not a complete list of the tools we use, but these are the tools I currently use on a daily basis: Tools  The Web Accessibility Toolbar (free add on for Internet Explorer) The Color Contrast Analyser (free desktop application for windows and Mac) aViewer (free desktop application for windows ) W3C Nu markup HTML conformance checker Firebug (free Firefox extension) Dom Inspector (free Firefox extension) Accprobe (free open source desktop application) Accessibility Inspector (free Mac appplication) UI Browser (NOT free Mac appplication)  Assistive Technology  JAWS (Screen Reader for windows, demo version available) NVDA (Free open source Screen Reader for windows) VoiceOver (Built in Screen Reader, Mac desktop and iPhone/iPod) ChromeVox (screen reader for Chrome and Chrome OS) Talkback (screen reader for Android) Zoomtext (Screen Magnifier for windows, demo version available)  More Tools I asked around the TPG virtual office (Skype group chat) and people recommended some more notable and useful tools:  Tenon (Tenon.io is an API that facilitates quick and easy JavaScript-aware accessibility testing) aDesigner (free open source desktop application) Juicy Studio Tools (free online tools and Firefox extensions)  Juicy Studio Accessibility Toolbar (free Firefox extension) Colour Contrast Analyser (free Firefox extension)   Accessibility Evaluation Toolbar (free Firefox extension) Wave Toolbar (free Firefox extension) Web Developer (free Firefox extension) Dragon (speech recognition software) Accessibility Developer Tools (for Chrome) iOS Simulator Jim Thatchers Favelets ARIA validator (for chrome) Quail (Accessibility testing in the browser and on the server)  Notes:  We do not use assistive technology in our technical testing to carry out user testing, we leave that up to actual users of assistive technology, who we work with as part of our user research and usability testing services. But as technical testers we do use assistive technology to evaluate the data we gather. Assistive technology is an essential part of the process for understanding how the accessibility information provided in user interfaces is conveyed to users. The tools listed above are only the tools I use regularly, other accessibility engineers at TPG may use other tools.   TPG elsewhere in 2016  Posted on Thursday, 22 December 2016 by Léonie Watson  Category: News   Many of us at TPG write and speak about things related to the web. This post collects together some of the articles, talks, books and meetups we’ve shared over the past 12 months.   Henny Swan gave the closing keynote at NUX (Northern UX conference). Her talk, The Velvet Rope included practical principles for barrier-free design. Karl Groves published many blog posts including On overlays as a means of resolving website accessibility issues, and The business case for issue prevention: extreme accessibility. He also talked about Extreme accessibility at CSUN 2016. Michiel Bijl organised several meetups under the banner of role=drinks. Sarah Horton released the fourth edition of her co-authored book Web Style Guide. David Sloan teamed up with Sarah to write Accessibility for business and pleasure for ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) Interactions magazine, and also to present Masterplanning the digital campus to support learners with disabilities, at the 13th W4A (Web For All) conference. Billy Gregory was part of the team behind the thoroughly excellent Accessibility Camp Toronto. Steve Faulkner posted Computer says no to HTML5 document outline, in his guise as one of the HTML5 Doctors. Heydon Pickering published his book Inclusive Frontend Design patterns, gave a riotous closing keynote on Joining the Dots at Fronteers 2016, and contributed What the heck is inclusive design? to this year’s 24 Ways collection. Adrian Roselli delivered a workshop version of his Selfish Accessibility talk, and posted numerous articles including Don’t recreate browser features and Be wary of nesting roles. Patrick Lauke talked about Getting touchy: an introduction to touch and pointer events at JavaScript Days 2016. Léonie Watson put a musical spin on accessibility with Technologic (Human afterall): Accessibility mix at FFconf, and shared her thoughts On CSS and drinking tea at CSS Day. Mike Paciello was at the White House for the Disability and Inclusive Technology summit, contributing to discussions about the IoT (Internet of Things) and inclusive design within tech development.   Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1  Posted on Friday, 8 June 2018 by Patrick H. Lauke  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   This week (5 June 2018) saw the release of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 as a W3C recommendation – meaning that the working group (which, among many others, included members from The Paciello Group) considers the guidelines stable and ready for implementation. WCAG 2.1 builds on top of WCAG 2.0, and it still incorporates all the guidelines and success criteria of 2.0. As such, it is backwards-compatible: a site that adheres to WCAG 2.1 automatically also adheres to WCAG 2.0. The aim of WCAG 2.1 is to provide guidance for aspects that were previously absent or underrepresented in 2.0. To this end, WCAG 2.1 includes 1 new overarching guideline (Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities) with 6 success criteria, as well as 11 new success criteria that fall under the existing guidelines already present in 2.0. These 17 new success criteria aim to address issues that affect:  people using “mobile” devices (though note that this term is somewhat archaic, as the boundaries between traditional categorizations of “desktop”, “mobile”, “tablet” are constantly blurring) people with low vision who may be using screen magnification or large text/zoom people with cognitive and learning disabilities people using speech input / dictation software  The new success criteria Guideline 1.3 Adaptable 1.3.4 Orientation (Level AA) Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential. This criterion is especially important in the context of mobile/tablet sites, to ensure that they don’t expect/limit their use to any particular orientation, as certain users may have their device statically mounted in a fixed orientation, and cannot easily change the orientation of their device. 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA) The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when:  The input field serves a purpose identified in the Input Purposes for User Interface Components section; and The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data.   1.3.6 Identify Purpose (AAA) In content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of User Interface Components, icons, and regions can be programmatically determined. These two criteria are aimed primarily at users with cognitive and learning disabilities. Ensuring that input and content purpose can be programmatically determined means that additional tools/assistive technologies have the potential to aid users to better understand and operate web content. For instance, in the context of login/account registration processes, programmatically identifiable form controls allow tools such as password managers to prefill/autofill certain known fields, which can greatly aid users with cognitive/memory issues. Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable 1.4.10 Reflow (AA) Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:  Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels; Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels;  Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning. This criterion fills a gap from WCAG 2.0. While 2.0 only required sites to allow users to zoom up to 200% without a loss of content/functionality, it did not cover scenarios in which zooming would result in content that then required horizontal and vertical scrolling. 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (AA) The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s):  User Interface Components Visual information used to indicate states and boundaries of user interface components, except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author; Graphical Objects Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed.   WCAG 2.0 only mandated specific minimum contrast requirements for text. This criterion now extends requirements to all user interface components (which may be purely graphical), their individual states, and general graphical objects (such as non-text-based icons). 1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA) In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:  Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size; Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size; Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size; Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.  Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script. In combination with the pre-existing criterion 1.4.5 Images of text, this ensures that users (particularly users with low vision) who benefit from specific text adaptations can set these without adversely impacting the layout/functionality of a site. 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA) Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:  Dismissable A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content; Hoverable If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing; Persistent The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.  Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author. This criterion is of particular relevance for low vision users, as it aims to ensures that content that appears on hover/focus is operable even when using screen magnification. Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A) If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:  Turn off A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; Remap A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-printable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, etc). Active only on focus The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus.   This criterion ensures that keyboard shortcut functionality is not accidentally triggered by users – something that can happen quite often in the case of speech input users when their assistive technology mistakes speech for specific keystrokes which are then sent to the page. Guideline 2.2 Enough Time 2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA) Users are warned of the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions. This criterion fills a gap from WCAG 2.0, which already covered some related aspects in 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable. Guideline 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA) Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed. This criterion is of particular relevance for users with vestibular disorders or vertigo, for whom motion effects on the screen can cause discomfort. Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities (new guideline in 2.1) 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A) All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential. Particularly on touch-screen devices it is common for content to provide functionality through gestures (such as swipes and pinch-to-zoom). This criterion requires that the same functionality is also available to users who are unable to perform these gestures, by providing controls that can be operated with a single tap/click. 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A) For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer, at least one of the following is true:  No Down-Event The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function; Abort or Undo Completion of the function is on the up-event, and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion; Up Reversal The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event; Essential Completing the function on the down-event is essential.   This criterion aims to prevent accidental activations using a pointer (mouse, stylus, finger on a touchscreen) – particularly relevant for users who may not have the fine motor skills required to always accurately operate their pointer device / use a touchscreen. 2.5.3 Label in Name (A) For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually. This criterion ensures that speech input users are able to unambiguously navigate to and activate controls by announcing the visible label of the control. 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A) Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when:  Supported Interface The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface; Essential The motion is essential for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity.   Particularly on portable (mobile/tablet) devices, it is possible for web content to react to motion (with functionality such as “shake to undo”, or by using the tilt of the device as a directional input). This criterion ensures that an alternative that does not require device motion is available. 2.5.5 Target Size (AAA) The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels except when:  Equivalent The target is available through an equivalent link or control on the same page that is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels; Inline The target is in a sentence or block of text; User Agent Control The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author; Essential A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed.   This criterion aims to ensure that all actionable controls in web content provide a sufficiently large “hit” area. This is relevant for users who may lack fine motor control. 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (AAA) Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is essential, required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect user settings. This criterion aims to ensure that people can use and switch between different modes of input when interacting with web content. Users may employ a variety of input mechanisms when interacting with web content. These may be a combination of mechanisms – such as a keyboard or keyboard-like interfaces – and pointer devices – like a mouse, stylus or touchscreen. As an example, this criterion should prevent sites from detecting the presence of a touchscreen and a touch-enabled laptop, or on a tablet with a paired physical keyboard and mouse, and simply assuming that touch is the only input mechanism the user will want to use. Guideline 4.1 Compatible 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA) In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus. In broad terms, this criterion would require messages (such as alerts, “toast” notifications, or any other status messages appearing on the screen) to be implemented in such a way that they can be announced by assistive technologies – for instance, using ARIA live regions. Adopting the new standard WCAG 2.0 is still a valid standard, which is used (often by being incorporated, either directly or by reference) as a measure of digital accessibility in a variety of industry standards, legislations and directives (such as the recently revised Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the new European standard on Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe (EN 301 549)). It is likely that in due course these will be updated to reference WCAG 2.1. However, as WCAG 2.1 is backwards-compatible with WCAG 2.0, website owners and authors are encouraged to begin following the new guidance included in 2.1 – they will still comply with the success criteria that are unchanged from 2.0, while the new guidelines in 2.1 will help towards creating a better, more accessible experience for their users (as well as ensuring that, once standards and legislations do update to WCAG 2.1, their sites will already be compliant).

It’s always good to meet up with the members of the team, colleagues, and friends in the industry, and make new friends. This year TPG had a series of first, but that made it all the better. We welcomed our newest recruits, Michiel Bijl (complete with his dinosaur onesie), Adrian Roselli, and Jon Metz. All the UX team made it to the conference for the first time and helped run the CSUN 2016 UXathon. TPG announced a strategic partnership with NV Access. And last but not least, our fearless leader, Mike Paciello, won the Knowbility lifetime achievement award (29 minutes in). TPG was also out in force at various events including the CSUN Tweetup, Wendy Chisholm’s karaoke night, and the Viking and Lumberjack hangout. But it wasn’t all karaoke and margaritas—we also gave a number of presentations. Here’s a quick roundup: Extreme Accessibility—Karl Groves This session provided a road map and job aids for Extreme Accessibility including tooling and processes for making Extreme Accessibility an integral part of quality processes. AD, CC and Me – Billy Gregory If accessibility is about inclusion, videos about accessibility should be too. Part case study, part primer learn how the Viking and the Lumberjack filmed, edited, added audio description, and captions to their series. Crossing the streams—Léonie Watson In this talk, Léonie used the Vibration API, Web Speech API, and CSS Speech module to cross the streams between mainstream and assistive technology for more accessible UX. Exploring the Use of the Web Audio API to Improve Chart Accessibility—Matt Atkinson Charts and plots are engaging and widely used, but present barriers to people with vision impairments. AudioChart provides an aural, keyboard-accessible means to experience them. Note: if you’re a screen-reader user, please disable styles in your browser. If you actually want to try AudioChart, the best thing to do is visit the AudioChart website and explore the examples linked from there. Matt also did his own write up of CSUN which is well worth a read. Breaking Silos—Ian Pouncey and Henny Swan A new take on an old problem. Breaking down silos to build a more collaborative accessibility process. Accessibility should be a collaborative effort in any organisation and team. Where guidelines, quality assurance and compliance provide the framework actual human beings are building products for other human beings and it’s that human factor that can get lost. In this talk we looked at some of the causes of these silos drawing on current industry practice as well as our own experience of working in large and small organisations. Embracing plain language for better accessibility—Ashley Bischoff This talk covered techniques that we can use to make our writing more understandable when we’re writing for those who might not work with accessibility. Accessibility Research Study: Humanizing the Need for Inclusive Design—David Sloan, Sarah Horton and Monica Reha We talked about a research study we ran with people who use assistive technology, exploring how they manage finances online. We shared our findings, and also discussed the logistical planning issues to consider in order to make sure that up-front research like this can be a valuable part of inclusive design. Designing for people—David Sloan and Sarah Horton This session prompted an audience discussion of three future scenarios we proposed, as radical accessibility for lasting change: What if we prioritised people with disabilities when making design decisions? What if we integrated accessibility into computer science and design education? What if accessibility investment was for new projects rather than fixing existing ones? David also wrote a CSUN reflection on his blog, CSUN (re)visited.  Complementing Standards by  Demonstrating Commitment and Progress  Posted on Friday, 22 May 2015 by Sarah Horton  Category: Strategy   By Sarah Horton, David Sloan, and Henny Swan Note: This is the manuscript version of the paper we presented at the 12th Web for All Conference (W4A 2015).

We want to ensure that all people are able to successfully access and use digital products and services. However, for many organizations, evidence of accessibility typically involves some declaration of standards compliance, and efforts toward accessibility focus on identifying and repairing issues in existing digital resources that fail to meet standards. When approached as a compliance activity, accessibility can seem daunting, if not impossible. Most sites and apps have hundreds, if not thousands, of pages and screens, and are in a state of constant flux, with a constant stream of new content and features. For many organizations, the digital landscape they seek to make accessible was constructed with little thought to accessibility, and contains third-party products and services over which they have little or no control. When “accessibility” means comprehensive and continuous compliance with standards, the positive energy around concern for people and striving for improvement gets spent finding and fixing bugs. As user experience consultants with an accessibility consultancy, we see first-hand the shortcomings of approaching accessibility as solely a standards compliance activity. Standards have a key role in defining and measuring progress toward accessibility. Standards are a guide for identifying and repairing accessibility issues. But in many cases, standards compliance is a narrow way to define accessibility, particularly with large, distributed systems and environments. In this position paper we propose a way to consider standards within a larger context of accessibility activity, with a particular focus on making progress and removing barriers to a quality user experience in existing digital environments. The Value of Standards In our role as consultants we evaluate the accessibility of a variety of digital products and services, including those that help people learn new things, connect with family and friends, manage finances, and purchase everything from bras to bulldozers. We work with organizations that are concerned with making sure people can engage in these activities, including people with disabilities. They know that their success as an enterprise depends on the success of their customers and users, as success builds brand loyalty, which in turn leads loyalty behavior such as repurchase and recommendations (Hassenzahl, 2013; Nielsen & Gilutz). But improving user experience is typically not the primary driver for engaging with an accessibility consultancy. Organizations are usually concerned with meeting obligations, providing people with disabilities with access to products and services. To that end, they want to learn what modifications and optimizations are required to make their products and services compliant with standards like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. In these cases, technical standards are seen primarily as a means to identify barriers—that is, attributes of an existing product or service that fail to meet standards and success criteria. We are seeing a gradual shift toward a more proactive approach to accessibility, engaging with organizations that are just beginning work on a new product or significant reworking of an existing product. In these cases we use standards as part of the project specification, defining accessibility attributes of the product from the start and measuring compliance with the standard throughout the design and development process. Standards have an enabling role, serving as a vehicle for integrating accessibility into use cases, wireframes, specifications, and code. Standards specify accessibility features Technical standards are helpful for specifying what attributes are needed for something—a product, a building, a website—to be accessible to people with disabilities. They specify attributes like dimensions and auxiliary features that are known to be helpful for and usable by people with disabilities—for example, in an elevator, the minimum door width needed to accommodate someone in a wheelchair or scooter, and raised and braille lettering on buttons and audible feedback, so people who are blind can select a floor and know when they’ve reached it. Architects and builders have solid specifications to follow when building features such as elevators. When building new digital products, specifications such as WCAG serve as a guide to decision-making. Product designers and developers that follow WCAG specifications can avoid creating accessibility barriers in the products they are building. Standards help flag accessibility barriers Standards are helpful for evaluation and benchmarking. With the elevator example, we can inspect an existing elevator to determine whether the dimensions and features are consistent with standards. If the elevator door is too narrow, or the buttons do not have raised letters, then the door is not in compliance with standards. With digital products, we use standards to measure attributes of existing features. With the help of standards we can determine whether, for example, controls are correctly labeled and are operable using a keyboard. The Limits of Only Standards Elevators make a good standards success story because they are well specified and there are solid protocols in place to evaluate, certify, and re-evaluate and certify over time. Of course, elevators do break, and some are more accessible and usable than others. But relative to other features of our shared environment, elevators are pretty straightforward. It is possible to be successful in complying with standards, and ensure elevators are stable and accessible over time (United States Access Board, 2010). On the other hand, digital products are dynamic, constantly changing, and are far less contained than features like elevators in the physical environment, and assessing their accessibility solely by measuring against standards will produce compliance failures. Also, standard-based assessments do not account for the impact of noncompliance on user experience, or on the completeness of the standard in terms of coverage of issues likely to be experienced by people with disabilities. Both these factors may lead to a standards-conformant website that contains significant barriers for people with disabilities (Power, Freire, Petrie, & Swallow, 2012). And finally, compliance audits tend to lead to remediation activity, which focuses energy and efforts on repairing features that are broken rather than considering a holistic solution to accessibility barriers (Kelly, Sloan, Phipps, Petrie, & Hamilton, 2005). Digital products are dynamic The digital environment is in constant flux. Websites are constantly changing and morphing, with new content, features, and updates. A page that meets accessibility standards one minute can fail the next, and a site judged to be accessible could become certifiably inaccessible in an instant, and due to the smallest compliance violation. Take for example user-contributed content. On a WCAG-conformant “accessible” site, a customer might post a product review containing a non-descriptive “click here” link and upload an image without descriptive text, causing the page to fail two Level A WCAG success criteria: 1.1.1 Non-text Content and 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context). With a purely compliance-based definition, these two issues, on a single piece of content provided by a third-party, cause the site to become “not accessible.” Digital products tend toward sprawl Most sites and apps have more screens than can be manually evaluated for accessibility. To address this reality, some organizations turn to automated testing tools, using software to evaluate compliance against accessibility standards. This approach has inherent limitations due to a lack of depth of some tests—for example, software can determine whether an image has a text alternative but cannot assess whether the text accurately describes the image. Tools are limited not only in their coverage of accessibility standards but also in their approach to assessing against those checkpoints that can be automatically tested (Vigo, Brown, & Conway, 2013). Some organizations opt to thoroughly evaluate only a sample of a site or app, using tools and manual tests to identify issues on the sample and then extrapolating from the results to identify and repair issues with content and functionality throughout. Due to limits of depth and breadth, neither approach can guarantee that all content and functionality is complaint with standards. Demonstrating Commitment and Progress What if, in addition to evaluating products against standards, we focus energy and resources on activities related to creating a culture, practice, and processes that support accessibility? A coordinated accessibility program, with documentation and continual assessment, provides the means to demonstrate commitment and progress toward achieving accessibility. In this way, accessibility moves from a standards-based remediation activity that is characterized by standards failures and technical remediation to an endeavor that is focused on people and good experience, and targets successful progress forward towards an accessible digital environment (Horton & Sloan, 2014). Here we present different models that could serve as the basis for further thinking and exploration of ways beyond standards compliance that an organization can show evidence of its efforts toward achieving accessibility. Accessibility has reporting standards In recent years, digital accessibility standards activity has addressed the importance of coordinated and sustained processes to support the provisioning of accessible digital products and environments. Here we focus on two standards—one from the United States and one from the United Kingdom—that address process and documentation. The 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) in the United States includes requirements around documenting accessibility efforts and progress toward barrier removal. Section 14.31, Recordkeeping requires manufacturers and service providers to create and maintain records about accessibility efforts, including: (1) information about the manufacturer’s or service provider’s efforts to consult with individuals with disabilities; (2) descriptions of the accessibility features of its products and services; and (3) information about the compatibility of its products and services with peripheral devices or specialized customer premise equipment commonly used by individuals with disabilities to achieve access. (CVAA, 2011) The recordkeeping requirements go on to specify how organizations must report progress, mandating that an officer of the manufacturer report annually through a compliance certificate to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). British Standards Institute Standard BS 8878 (British Standards Institute, 2010) presents a 16-step process for creating and procuring accessible web products. BS8878 encourages a process of documenting decisions and justification for them throughout the project lifecycle, and recognizes organizations may need to take a pragmatic approach where accessibility aspirations come into conflict with other objectives or are affected by project constraints. Step 15 of BS8878 specifically relates to communication of accessibility decisions at launch, including examples of where accessibility is not optimal, as might be the case in an early launch where some compromises have had to be made (Hassell, 2014). The approach of documenting and justifying decisions that do not favor accessibility rather than being prohibited from making them should provide organizations with some flexibility to deal with situations where accessibility is not readily achievable. Models Exist in the Built Environment Standards for accessibility of public services and facilities are far more mature than digital accessibility standards. In this section we take a high-level look of how the American Disabilities Act (ADA) and the ADA Standards for Accessible Design support progress toward accessible environments, working toward positive and lasting change with long-standing services and facilities constructed without the benefit of accessibility specifications. We argue that this scenario closely matches that of the complex and decentralized digital environments that we commonly evaluate, most of which were constructed without guidance from standards, and now require often substantial and difficult remediation activities to achieve compliance. The ADA scoping requirements in particular are helpful as a model for shaping obligations to fit their context of application. When specifying requirements for the built environment, the ADA differentiates between the following activities:  Building a new facility: When building a new facility, businesses must ensure the new facility is compliant with accessibility standards. For example, a new library building must meet specifications for accessibility. Altering an existing facility: When altering features of an existing facility, businesses must ensure the alterations are compliant with accessibility standards. Additionally, any accessibility barriers present in the “path of travel” to the altered area must be addressed. For example, a library might renovate a wing of its building to house a new media lab. If the drinking fountain en route to the media lab is not compliant, some monies from the project must be reserved to install an accessible drinking fountain. Removing barriers in an existing facility: Businesses must work to remove existing accessibility barriers. These efforts start with evaluating the existing facility and developing and acting on a barrier removal plan. Informing the plan is the notion of “readily achievable,” whereby the barrier removal is “easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much difficulty or expense.” Readily achievable is measured in context—for example, large and well-resourced businesses are expected to remove more barriers than small businesses. Examples of barrier removal might include installing accessible door handle or installing an entry ramp.  These concepts apply to “places of public accommodations.” The ADA has 12 categories of businesses that provide goods and services to the public, including stores, restaurants, libraries, hotels, hospitals, and more. Organizations in these categories are obligated to take measures to ensure people with disabilities are able to access services and communications (United States Access Board; United States Department of Justice). Translating these concepts to the digital environment, an organization could assess the public areas of their digital landscape (“places of public accommodations”) and establish a policy and processes to support the following approach:  Creating a new digital resource: All new technology development must follow accessibility standards. Any new technology brought into the digital environment, including those from third-party providers, must be accessible. Altering an existing digital resource: When altering an existing website or application, such as adding a new feature, the new feature must be compliant with accessibility standards. For example, a live chat “ask a librarian” feature must meet accessibility standards. Modeling on the “path of travel” concept, there must be a specified effort to bring all pages that include the chat feature and the pages and paths leading to the chat feature into standards compliance. Removing existing barriers: All websites and applications in the environment must be evaluated for accessibility. Existing barriers must be noted, and organizations must make a plan for fixing accessibility issues. Modeling on the “readily achievable” concept, barriers that are easy to accomplish and do not require much difficulty or expense take priority, and remaining issues are regularly revisited to reassess achievability. The impact of issues on accessibility must also be a factor in determining priority.  With this framework in place, organizations can establish an accessibility program, guided by careful and deliberate attention to making progress. In their Checklist for Existing Facilities (Adaptive Environments, 1995) prepared for the National Institute for Disability and Rehabilitation Research, Adaptive Environments Center provides a straightforward and ongoing program for identifying accessibility issues and developing an implementation plan for remediating barriers in a facility.  Get organized: Establish a timeframe for evaluating the facility. Invite people with disabilities and people with expertise in accessibility evaluation to assist in identifying barriers and solutions. Obtain floor plans: Gather floor plans to assist in documenting issues in the facility. Conduct the survey: Take notes and record dimensions. Document the experience of the space from different perspectives, including with physical, visual, hearing, and cognitive disabilities. Summarize barriers and solutions: List the barriers identified and consider solutions. Learn about costs and timeframes for modifications. Make decisions and set priorities: Review the summary with stakeholders to decide which solutions to pursue. For those that are not readily achievable, develop a plan for alternative access. Make an implementation plan. Maintain documentation: Keep the survey, notes, and plans up to date. Make changes: Remediate planned changes and update implementation plan to reflect barrier removal activities. Follow up: Revisit the implementation plan and revise when changes become readily achievable.  Taking this planning framework to the digital environment, a similar approach might be along these lines:  Get organized: Establish a timeframe for evaluating digital resources. Reach out to people with disabilities, and engage digital accessibility experts to assist with evaluation and solution identification. Obtain resource documentation: Gather together documentation and specifications for the digital resources. Conduct audit: Evaluate the resource against digital accessibility standards. Summarize barriers and solutions: List the barriers identified, assess their impact and how much resource will be required for remediation. Propose solutions. Make decisions and set priorities: Inform stakeholders of issues and work together to decide which issues to address. Make a plan for all other issues, including a plan for addressing access issues that may arise for solutions that are not readily achievable. Create an implementation plan. Maintain documentation: Use the audit to establish a baseline. Update the baseline to reflect changes, including new resources and any redesign and remediation activities. Make changes: Remediate planned changes. Perform retests as needed to respond to remediation activity, and update the audit and implementation plan. Follow up: Revisit the implementation plan and revise when changes become readily achievable.  This approach complements BS8878, which defines steps for complete projects, by focusing on the process of pragmatic and practical remediation of large, complex digital estates, where “throwing away and starting again” is not an option. Conclusion We partner with organizations to help meet obligations for providing digital products and services that are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities. We use standards to identify existing barriers. In some cases, repairing barriers is straight-forward—in others, more complex. Achieving and sustaining compliance with technical standards in an environment as complex and dynamic as a large organizational website is not realistic. However, persistent attention to providing accessible digital environments is essential, so we need measures in addition to standards compliance to keep advancing toward accessibility. We see an important role for process standards related to recordkeeping and reporting to ensure accessibility efforts focus on people and are pointed in the direction of success. We also can learn from standards in the physical environment, and model efforts on progress made in building accessible places of public accommodation. We must be realistic in our expectations, and differentiate between new digital resources and those that are long-standing and difficult to repair. We should also consider the notion of “readily achievable” as a way to focus prioritization and remediation efforts around barriers that are easy and inexpensive to remove and will have the greatest impact. When partnering with organizations, we begin by establishing a baseline, documenting the current state of accessibility in existing resources. We then embark on a process of improving accessibility, while at the same time establishing a response plan to address any difficulties that might arise from known issues. As we engage with organizations on creating accessibility in practice, we believe activities that show commitment and progress have as much, if not more, lasting value as standards compliance on making progress toward accessible digital environments.

Proceedings of the 2013 International Cross-Disciplinary Workshop on Web Accessibility (W4A).   Making real progress in digital accessibility in higher education  Posted on Friday, 6 February 2015 by David Sloan  Category: News   We were delighted to see the University of Colorado at Boulder recently announce the appointment of a Chief Digital Accessibility Officer, and also announce recruitment for an IT Accessibility Manager. The TPG UX team has been working with CU-Boulder for the past few months to help them create a roadmap and strategy towards a culture and practice of excellence in digital accessibility, and we’re really excited to see their thoughtfulness, enthusiasm and determination in taking such a progressive approach, documented on their Accessible Technology web site. Equal access to education, for people with disabilities is a fundamental human right. We know that technology has a huge opportunity to widen access to learning and enrich the learning experience; and, yet, we also know that it can inadvertently introduce new barriers. But implementing a workable and effective accessibility strategy in higher education has a number of complex challenges, including the unique mix of organizational, academic, financial and legal drivers that can make it difficult to create a coherent and sustainable campus-wide policy. The tension between academic standards, desire for innovation and excellence, and perceived restrictions that accessibility requirements might bring has always been close to the surface—most recently in discussions over the need for and predicted implications of the draft TEACH Act (see comments from Educause and from NCDAE/WebAIM as examples of different views). Here in the TPG UX team, many years of experience working in higher education have given us insight into some of the practical challenges that committed and enthusiastic advocates of digital accessibility who work in a university can’t address on their own. It’s also given us a passion to help higher education institutions come together to assess their current state, identify challenges and opportunities, and chart a route to a culture and practice of digital accessibility. We need to recognize these challenges that exist and are not easy to overcome, particularly where institutionalized practices or limitations of existing technology make digital accessibility hard to deliver effectively. We also need to identify and harness the enthusiasm, skills, and power that exists in copious quantities in every higher education institution that can help to make sure that accessibility is an influencing factor in creating, procuring and using technology in all aspects of a university’s operation. We’re on the cusp of a new era of inclusive, technology-enhanced learning experiences, and TPG is really excited to be part of it. That’s why we have such a strong commitment to work with educational organisations to help them deliver the highest quality and most inclusive online learning experiences. Update, 9 June 2015 We recently heard the good news that the Department of Justice has closed their inquiry into CU-Boulder’s digital accessibility practice, which is validation of the efforts the university has made to improve their capacity and strategy for delivering an accessible and inclusive online campus. We know that CU-Boulder will be the first to recognise that progress will be gradual, and that not everything can be fixed immediately. However the value of a clear strategy, strong leadership, a shared responsibility, and staff with enthusiasm, knowledge and skills, will give the university a terrific platform to build a sustainable approach to digital accessibility, and we congratulate CU-Boulder on their efforts.  Accessible User Experience and W3C-WAI  Posted on Thursday, 27 June 2013 by David Sloan  Category: UX Tag: WCAG   Building an optimally accessible web site involves creating a technical platform that is as robust as possible under different browsing situations, including diverse assistive technology/browser combinations. Following the technical guidelines published by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an important part of this process. However, the ultimate focus of people with disabilities, like any other member of your target audience, is not simply to visit a technically accessible web site but to successfully use the site to reach a desired goal – which might be to complete a task, or achieve a particular experience (even if it is just to pass some time!). It is often assumed this aspect of a site’s quality, commonly referred to as user experience (UX), is out of scope of the material produced by WAI, which is dominated by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Debates on the relationship of UX to measuring accessibility show there are different perspectives on this issue. But let’s look a bit closer to see where WAI does encourage a focus on UX in designing accessible web sites, and how that can help guide you in decision-making throughout the design and development process.  WCAG conformance and user experience WCAG conformance focuses primarily on the web page as a unit of conformance. So to claim a certain level of accessibility conformance, a page must meet all WCAG Success Criteria up to and including that level. However, conformance also covers the concept of processes: When a Web page is one of a series of Web pages presenting a process (i.e., a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity), all Web pages in the process conform at the specified level or better. This acknowledges the importance of task completion in evaluating accessibility – but leaves you, as an author, with the responsibility of deciding and defining which processes need to be supported. If you substitute the concept of “processes” with “goal success”, you can see how this approach can make a connection between technical conformance and accessible user experience. Designing for inclusion Good UX design requires that you understand your target audience and their context of use. The Designing for Inclusion section of the WAI web site provides a range of very useful resources helping you appreciate more about how people with disabilities use the web. Good use is made of user stories to help you to explore the diverse characteristics of disability, the different ways in which people with disabilities use the web, and the range of assistive technologies available. A page on web accessibility and older people covers the overlap between the experiences and challenges of older Web users and the challenges for people with disabilities. The overlap between designing accessible web sites and sites that work well on mobile devices is covered in the mobile accessibility section. Effective involvement of people with disabilities in the design process Good UX design requires regular consideration of users throughout the design lifecycle. WAI’s Planning and Implementing section provides some resources which can help you plan to involve people with disabilities as much as possible from as early as possible. In particular, the resource on involving users in web projects for better, easier accessibility provides some valuable advice on how to effectively recruit and work with people with diverse disabilities early and throughout your project: Early on, learn about general issues related to what you are developing, e.g., websites, web tools, standards, or other products. Ask people to show you websites or related products that work well for them. Then, ask them to show you problems in products that do not work well. Ask lots of questions to help you understand the accessibility issues. Throughout your design and development, ask users to review prototypes. Give them specific tasks to complete and see how the different aspects of the design and coding could be improved. Ask lots of questions. These are activities that are fundamental to designing a quality user experience; involving people with disabilities helps ensure this quality experience is also inclusive. Involving users in evaluation Good UX design recognises that improvement comes from planned evaluation, reflection and iteration. Aside from conformance-driven technical evaluation, WAI provides some useful advice on how to effectively involve people with disabilities during evaluation activties. While this page focuses on accessibility evaluation rather than UX evaluation, the results of accessibility evaluation will nevertheless be helpful in enhancing the user experience. WAI’s advice includes guidance on how to use the results of each evaluation appropriately, recognising there can be limitations in the data gathered from one individual: A person with a disability does not necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with the web, nor know enough about other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility issues. But the value of involving people with disabilities in helping to improve the user experience for everyone is made clear: In addition to finding accessibility problems, evaluating with users with disabilities usually reveals general usability problems that impact all users, including those without disabilities. While WAI’s focus is fundamentally on web accessibility, these and other WAI resources can help you integrate accessibility into user experience design processes, to design more inclusive online user experiences. NB Some of the WAI resources referenced in this article are currently in draft, and so might have changed since this article was written.   New book chapter: Accessible online learning  Posted on Thursday, 6 July 2017 by David Sloan  Category: News   Many months ago, Mary Ziegler (Program Manager for Online Accessibility at MIT) and I started work on a chapter on Accessible Online Learning for a new book, Disability, Human Rights and Information Technology, published by University of Pennsylvania press. Last week I finally got my hands on a physical copy of the book, and from a first glance, it looks terrific. This short post outlines our chapter and the rest of the book’s content.  Accessible online learning is a great example of how well-designed technology can empower people with disabilities to gain knowledge and skills, qualifications and connections, and enter employment, without having to deal with the barriers presented by physical environments. Technology can reduce or overcome the effect of inaccessible classrooms, educational materials, and teaching methods. So online learning that contains accessibility barriers is a particularly retrograde step towards supporting the rights of all humans to education. In our chapter, we provide a review of legislation and standards relevant to education, technology, and disability. We discuss the many stakeholders who have a responsibility and role to play in the delivery of accessible online learning, including:  developers, providers and vendors of educational technology and digital resources, IT, disability and other central services at education providers, teachers, instructors, faculty, and others delivering online learning experiences, researchers in educational technology, creators of standards, policy and legislation, and learners with disabilities  We talk about the barriers and challenges present that inhibit progress towards accessible online learning, and outline the responsibilities of each stakeholder group to address these challenges and remove barriers. The intersection of disability, technology and legislation is such a rapidly changing space that it might seem pointless to try to document the current state in a book, and no doubt by the time you read it, something will be out of date! But the editors Jonathan Lazar and Michael Ashley Stein have done a great job, and this book looks like it’ll provide a valuable reference that will stay useful over time. Using the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) as its common thread, the book starts with chapters setting the legal scene connecting disability, human rights and technology. It then explores more specific topics such as captioning, gaming, privacy and security. There’s also a welcome section dedicated to developments in the Global South, something those of us who work in the West can always learn more about. The book is available to buy from the usual online locations.  Anybody can be an A11y Slacker  Posted on Friday, 17 July 2015 by Steve Faulkner  Category: News   There are many ways to communicate about accessible web development practices; mailing lists, forums, IRC, articles, twitter, slack and gitter etc. Each has it’s pros and cons. I have been frequenting an A11y Slack (get an invite) of late. I have found it a good place to mix it up with accessibility folk and web developers. But Slack has issues for users; its UI is not accessible and while it can also be used via IRC, the output of IRC has proven problematic. Also an issue with access to chat history arose, which has graciously been sorted by SlackHQ. I also find it a problem that while anyone can join, the content of the slack can only been viewed after sign in.  Giving Gitter a Go Mike[tm]Smith suggested Gitter as an alternative:  @stevefaulkner Time to switch to @gitchat（actually shoulda began there instead but not too late to fix the mistake…) https://t.co/jQ5TrnYTKn — Michael[tm] Smith (@sideshowbarker) July 15, 2015  So I thought i would give it a go, hence A11ySlackers was born. Some immediate advantages I found; It’s publicly viewable without sign in. The archives are public, it integrates with Github, so if you have a github account you can sign in with it to chat. While the web UI sucks accessibility wise to a similar extent that Slack does, the IRC bridge is more practically usable for people who find the Web UI problematic. I have found it easy to scrape (manually at this stage) the public archives to create a permanent record of discussions in a W3C repo:  Any help with this appreciated https://t.co/r7L5LaTODF #A11ySlackers — Steve Faulkner (@stevefaulkner) July 16, 2015 I have begun filing bugs about Gitters web UI accessibility and suggest other people do the same. The newly formed W3C Web Incubator Community Group is making use of Gitter, so I for one have a vested interest in helping make Gitter more usable and accessible. Great, what is it? A channel for anyone and everyone to discuss accessible web development What it is not: an official channel of the W3C or of any organisation. So drop in and say Hi or lurk, ask a question or answer a question, share info, help make the web more accessible and usable for all. It’s not exclusive, no question is too simple, only rule is: be nice.  A11ySlackers on Gitter Connect via IRC Channel Archive Github Repo  Breaking Down Silos with Sameroom An issue with having venues for discussion on mulitple platforms is that unless people are tuned into multiple places valuable opportunities for knowledge transfer can be lost. We are currently experimenting with Sameroom, a service which allows us to have the best of both worlds (use of Gitter and Slack) as venues for people to discuss accessible web development. Using Sameroom the web-a11y Slack room and the A11ySlackers Gitter room have been joined, so discussion can be carried out between rooms using the service of your choice. It has overcome the issues with Slack IRC bridge (users can log into Gitter IRC and chat with people in slack and gitter) and also we get the benefits of the more public nature of the Gitter service.    ((window.gitter = {}).chat = {}).options = {     room: \\'w3c/a11ySlackers\\'   };    Web Accessibility Toolbar 2012 – silent install  Posted on Friday, 18 May 2012 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Strategy   We get quite a few requests  for a silent install package for the Web Accessibility Toolbar.

EU Directive on the Accessibility of Public Sector Websites and Mobile Applications  Posted on Thursday, 26 April 2018 by Léonie Watson  Category: Standards   The European Union (EU) Directive on the Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications requires EU member states to make sure their websites and mobile apps meet common accessibility standards. The Directive will be transposed into the laws of each EU member state by September 23 2018.  The Directive uses the four principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, requiring that public sector organisations across the EU take steps to make sure their websites are “Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust”. The Directive references EN 301 549 as the standard which will enable websites and apps to comply with the law. EN 301 549 is a set of Functional Accessibility requirements broken down into chapters, and chapter 9 on Web Content cites WCAG 2.0 Level AA as the expected standard. The W3C is close to publishing WCAG 2.1, an update to WCAG 2.0 that introduces many Success Criteria (SC) focused on mobile apps, as well as SC relating to low vision and cognitive disability. The W3C anticipates that WCAG 2.1 will be released in June 2018, and EN 301 549 could be updated to include the new SC introduced in WCAG 2.1. Once adopted into the laws of each EU member state, the Directive sets a timetable for compliance with the new regulations:  New public sector websites must conform by September 23 2019 All public sector websites by September 23 2020 All public sector mobile apps by June 23 2021  In order to comply with the Directive, public sector organisations will need to monitor the accessibility of their websites and mobile apps, make information from the monitoring available in an accessibility statement, and provide reports to a central authority. These requirements mean that many EU public sector organisations will need to rethink their accessibility strategy in the coming months if they are to be ready when the Directive comes into effect on September 23 2018.

Download the Press Release  Accessibility testing tools  Posted on Wednesday, 29 September 2010 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Testing Tag: Accessibility InspectorTag: aViewerTag: CCATag: WAT   Here at The Paciello Group (TPG) we have a technical accessibility testing process which does not involve the use of automated tools. The technical audit results we provide to our clients are based solely on manual testing of a web site, web application, mobile or desktop application.   Typically, but not solely, we conduct technical testing in reference to the following accessibility standards:  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (web sites and web applications and other ICT) Section 508 1194.21- Software Applications and Operating Systems (desktop applications and web applications) Section 508 1194.22 – Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications (web sites and web applications) Section 508 Refresh Standards  (Formal title: Draft Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Standards and Guidelines).  To aid us in our manual testing process we use a number of tools and assistive technologies, the following is not a complete list of the tools we use, but these are the tools I currently use on a daily basis: Tools  The Web Accessibility Toolbar (free add on for Internet Explorer) The Color Contrast Analyser (free desktop application for windows and Mac) aViewer (free desktop application for windows ) W3C Nu markup HTML conformance checker Firebug (free Firefox extension) Dom Inspector (free Firefox extension) Accprobe (free open source desktop application) Accessibility Inspector (free Mac appplication) UI Browser (NOT free Mac appplication)  Assistive Technology  JAWS (Screen Reader for windows, demo version available) NVDA (Free open source Screen Reader for windows) VoiceOver (Built in Screen Reader, Mac desktop and iPhone/iPod) ChromeVox (screen reader for Chrome and Chrome OS) Talkback (screen reader for Android) Zoomtext (Screen Magnifier for windows, demo version available)  More Tools I asked around the TPG virtual office (Skype group chat) and people recommended some more notable and useful tools:  Tenon (Tenon.io is an API that facilitates quick and easy JavaScript-aware accessibility testing) aDesigner (free open source desktop application) Juicy Studio Tools (free online tools and Firefox extensions)  Juicy Studio Accessibility Toolbar (free Firefox extension) Colour Contrast Analyser (free Firefox extension)   Accessibility Evaluation Toolbar (free Firefox extension) Wave Toolbar (free Firefox extension) Web Developer (free Firefox extension) Dragon (speech recognition software) Accessibility Developer Tools (for Chrome) iOS Simulator Jim Thatchers Favelets ARIA validator (for chrome) Quail (Accessibility testing in the browser and on the server)  Notes:  We do not use assistive technology in our technical testing to carry out user testing, we leave that up to actual users of assistive technology, who we work with as part of our user research and usability testing services. But as technical testers we do use assistive technology to evaluate the data we gather. Assistive technology is an essential part of the process for understanding how the accessibility information provided in user interfaces is conveyed to users. The tools listed above are only the tools I use regularly, other accessibility engineers at TPG may use other tools.   Section 508 Refresh (Part 2)  Posted on Friday, 12 January 2018 by Matt Feldman  Category: NewsCategory: StandardsCategory: Webinars Tag: 508Tag: Section 508Tag: WCAG   The wait is over! The January 18 delayed compliance date for the revised Section 508 standards is almost upon us.   In Part 1 of our Section 508 Refresh series we focused on the background, history and highlighted some of the key changes influencing the revised Section 508 standards.   In today’s article, we are shifting focus to the important initiatives that have taken place to better prepare agencies and vendors to support this new accessibility standard. Original 508 vs Revised 508 Standards If you are familiar with the original Section 508 law and technical standards – you also have the task of reassessing your understanding of law and technical requirements. Essentially, you need to be retrained. While you can expect a significant number of new requirements many are substantially the same but renamed or expanded upon. To ease this transition the US Access Board has created a variety of comparative tables to reinforce what is new and where existing requirements may still live under a different name or category.  WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA Success Criteria Final Rule Requirements for Software Final Rule Requirements for Hardware and Telecommunications Equipment Final Rule Accessibility Requirements for Support Documentation and Services  Defining Requirements Before developing and testing new ICT that meets these new standards, organization must first accurately define which requirements apply. While a shift to a function-based approach should improve the accuracy, this exercise will place  a greater dependence on the knowledge of the ICT’s feature-set. To meet this challenge GSA is developing the Accessibility Requirements Tool (ART), expecting to launch it early in 2018. This step-by-step guide will assist in the accurate identification and documentation of accessibility requirements. Until it’s release, customers are encouraged to take advantage of instructions and checklists available in the Revised 508 Standards Toolkit. WCAG 2.0 Though the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) is only one of ten different standards incorporated by reference, this W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) standard will have perhaps the most significant influence with it comes to global harmonization and testing. WCAG 2.0 is designed to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation.   By incorporating these guidelines by reference, organization can leverage a considerable amount of technical documentation that has been developed by the community over many years. While the inclusion of WCAG 2.0 is viewed as a significant leap forward please keep the perspective that this was initially published in 2008. In fact, the W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group W3C is well underway with important guideline updates in version 2.1 to address gaps with user needs and technology advancement.  WCAG 2.1 has an expected publication date of June 2018. It’s important to note that updates to this guideline will not automatically roll into Section 508.  Section 508 will only require conformance with the Success Criteria defined in WCAG 2.0 Level A & AA until the law is revised again.   At that point in time we may be discussing WCAG 3.0 – or beyond! Conformance Documentation When Section 508 originally became law federal procurement officials were expected to purchase the most compliant product – but how could they possible make this determination?  Hence the creation of the VPAT® 1.0 format which was developed by the ITI – Information Technology Industry Council in partnership with GSA in 2001. A VPAT® or Voluntary Product Accessibility Template® is a self-disclosing document produced by the vendor which details each aspect of the Section 508 requirements and how the product supports each criterion. In October of this year, ITI released the final version of this accessibility conformance report — VPAT® 2.0.  This new format was developed to align with the Revised Section 508 standards but also expands to other guidelines making the format more broadly used in the global marketplace. These standards include:  Revised Section 508 standards – the U.S. Federal accessibility standard EN 301 549 – the European Union’s “Accessibility requirements suitable for public procurement of ICT products and services in Europe” WCAG 2.0 – W3C/WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  Beyond this there are a number of other significant improvements in the document including an Evaluation Methods Used field to describe methods used to test the product’s accessibility which will provide more accountability in generating accurate conformance statements.  The document also includes detailed instructions and best practice recommendations for greater consistency across manufacturers. To learn more about the Revised Section 508 Standards and VPAT® 2.0, please join us for a webinar on Thursday, January 18 at 11:30AM EST.  AOL Selects The Paciello Group to Enhance Accessibility of Dynamic Web Applications  Posted on Monday, 22 March 2010 by Mike Paciello  Category: News   The Paciello Group (TPG) has been selected by AOL to enhance the accessibility of jQuery, a popular open source toolkit used to build dynamic web applications. This work will foster greater compatibility between consumer-facing web applications and assistive technology used by people with disabilities to access the Internet. Enhancements will incorporate the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Accessible Rich Internet Application Specification and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. “Embedding accessibility support into widely used toolkits like jQuery is essential in order for people with disabilities to take full advantage of services delivered via web applications built by AOL and developers around the world,” said Tom Wlodkowski, AOL’s accessibility director. “Our goal is to minimize the barriers application developers confront today in making rich web interfaces accessible.” The initial focus of the AOL/TPG partnership is to assess the current level of accessibility of jQuery user interface (UI) components. TPG will then contribute JavaScript code to address gaps in accessibility to the jQuery community. AOL uses jQuery extensively and will leverage the accessible components in future consumer-facing web applications. When released in the next version of jQuery, any developer using the toolkit will inherit these accessibility enhancements. “TPG is excited about our partnership with AOL,” stated Mike Paciello, founder and president of The Paciello Group. “We see this as an incredible opportunity to influence the usability of next generation web applications and to promote the inclusion of users with disabilities. By enhancing the jQuery developer toolkit, developers will have the framework for building accessible and usable rich internet applications.” This project is also supported with the financial contribution of the European Commission in the context of the ÆGIS project (Open Accessibility Everywhere: Groundwork, Infrastructure, Standards). The AEGIS project is focused on the research and development of solutions to advance accessibility of mainstream ICT (desktop, rich Internet and mobile applications).

In which our hero slips and falls  Posted on Wednesday, 20 September 2017 by Billy Gregory  Category: UX   A couple weeks ago I had what I jokingly referred to as “an old guy moment”. I slipped and fell in the shower. I realize that my age has nothing to do with this, it could happen to anyone, at any time, at any age, and it happened to me. If anyone has seen me present before, you’ve probably heard me mention that if you want to find examples of bad UX, look no further than the nearest bathroom. Never before has this been more painfully obvious to me. Allow me to set the scene. I had just finished showering and, as I have always done, I stepped out of the tub with one foot and reached for my towel hanging within reach on the door. The difference this time is that the foot still in the tub slipped and rotated somewhere between 45 to 90 degrees, made a sickening “thunk thunk” as it popped, and I went down… hard. I quickly realized that I absolutely, 100%, could not get up. My knee was done, and I had to call my girlfriend to come help me up and out of the tub. This was me at my absolute most vulnerable, remember I had just finished showering, and I totally stopped showering in my bathing suit sometime after 11th grade. I did not want to call for help, but I had no choice. I was stuck. Fast forward a week and half. I was moving around ok now but since my fall I was really nervous about falling again. So nervous in fact, that I had taken to showering sitting in the tub or bathing. I realized I had to shower, but I couldn’t follow the same process that caused me to fall the first time, it was user tested and was decidedly flawed and needed to be fixed.  I thought about what I could change. Remodeling was out of the question. I rent my place and I can’t spend that kind of money. So I looked at what went wrong: the towel was too far away from where it was needed, so I moved it. Now, the towel didn’t make me fall, reaching for it while half-standing in a slippery tub did. So I bought a bathmat. I’m not the only person who showers at my house, my girlfriend and two daughters are also huge fans of not being disgusting. Thing is, I’m the only that fell, so I bought a mat. Guess what? This thing I put there for my own needs ended up being used by everyone. They didn’t need it, but they sure loved it once it was there. Does any of this sound familiar? My towel, a control, was located too far away and it caused a user error. When it was moved closer to where it was needed, the user stopped falling and dislocating their knee. The bathmat was a feature built for one particular user that made everyone’s experience more enjoyable. By tweaking the foundation that the experience was built on, it made for a safer and quicker experience for everyone. Whether the other users noticed or not, they were most likely aware that the tub was slippery and couldn’t get the job done as quickly as they could once the mat was installed. Oh, and for those of you who screamed “Why didn’t you have a bathmat?!”, sometimes we don’t use the right elements at the right time when we’re in a rush. And that’s all it took. In order to make things more accessible, I made a couple of slight design changes. These changes didn’t really affect the look or feel, annoy other users, cost a ton of money, but it did improve the experience and reduced user “drop off” by at least 25%. And that’s all this user “kneeded”.  HTML5 and alt: The editors new clothes  Posted on Thursday, 1 May 2008 by Steve Faulkner  Category: Development Tag: HTML   The HTML5 editor has recently stated in his defence of the alt being optional: “We truly do believe in research, hard data, and analysis, rather than hypotheticals; and we truly do believe that evidence suggests that what we are arguing for is going to improve the accessibility of the Web.” Problem is, no “research, hard data, and analysis” has been provided. If the editor has such detailed research,  please provide it so that the members of the HTML working group and those groups within the W3C WAI that have a stake in this issue, can use the “research, hard data, and analysis” to inform their decision. Show us the goods To put the matter in perspective: What we don’t need from the editor is more Google code statistics and a bit of pseudo scientific prose, dressing the statistics up as facts to support his argument.  What is required from the editor to back up his claims? A proper scientific study that is based on scientific method. Research with firm aims and objectives stated up front, with an agreed methodology.  Scientific Method For the sake of clarity, I have reproduced some information about the steps involved in the scientific method: The scientific method has four steps  Observation and description of a phenomenon or group of phenomena. Formulation of an hypothesis to explain the phenomena. In physics, the hypothesis often takes the form of a causal mechanism or a mathematical relation. Use of the hypothesis to predict the existence of other phenomena, or to predict quantitatively the results of new observations. Performance of experimental tests of the predictions by several independent experimenters and properly performed experiments.  If the experiments bear out the hypothesis it may come to be regarded as a theory or law of nature (more on the concepts of hypothesis, model, theory and law below). If the experiments do not bear out the hypothesis, it must be rejected or modified. What is key in the description of the scientific method just given is the predictive power (the ability to get more out of the theory than you put in; see Barrow, 1991) of the hypothesis or theory, as tested by experiment. It is often said in science that theories can never be proved, only disproved. There is always the possibility that a new observation or a new experiment will conflict with a long-standing theory. Conclusion If a scientific study with firm aims and objectives stated up front, and an agreed methodology is not forthcoming, we are in the position of reliance on expert opinion, rationale argument and the hope of concensus within the HTML WG or if not a vote on the issue. Whatever route is taken, let’s get this issue sorted so we can move on to other important accessibility issues within HTML5.

The context of the discussion involved the need of legal mandates to enforce web accessibility. In turn, this led to a discussion involving the ROI of web accessibility. Following were (and still are!) my brief thoughts on this topic: A venture capital friend of mind once said, “To build a successful business you need one of two things: 1) A brilliant, paradigm shifting, mind blowing product (i.e., iPad/iPhone, Google, Facebook) or 2) A law that makes your business mandatory.” To a limited degree the accessibility business has achieved #2 — we have laws, mostly procurement laws — that require accessibility. Unfortunately, enforcement is only taken seriously by the minority. Law suits by various disability constituency organizations are an extension of the law — but they also create a fear-based model of compliance. And, as Jonathan Hassell notes in his blogs, neither generates a business value proposition for most (if not all) commercial and government entities. Jonathan also makes a great point about the lack of data and statistics that drill into disability usage. We also lack the architecture at the API and DOM levels that could feed the SEO data to the source such that AT usage is perceived. The moment a web property — site, service, or application — attempts to elicit personal data, even something as simple as the AT-type, concerns involving privacy and self-identification are raised. Please be sure to read Jonathan’s blogs on web accessibility:  Accessibility Myths, Part 1 Accessibility Myths Part 2  Recent vendor information I’ve read indicates that less than 3% of all people with visual disabilities have screen magnifiers and/or screen reader technology at all. Without AT that connects to an internet user agent, how will these folks interact with a web site? If they don’t interact with a web site to buy products, make travel/hotel reservations, perform bank transactions, and/or access government services, why would a business or government accommodate them? Businesses cater to sales, revenues, and profits. Accessibility — optimized at any level — provides no solution involving these concerns. That is, we can make a site accessible and usable but that doesn’t guarantee that users (consumers) will come. It means that some users will come (i.e., those that have AT that is compatible with the web). But those users are so few in comparison to other internet demographics that they are hardly compelling enough to move a business to accommodate the consumer with a disability. It’s certainly not compelling enough to suggest that a business will change priorities. Make no mistake about it colleagues — if we don’t make changes — of the paradigm shifting magnitude — I predict that 80% or better of individuals with ALL disabilities will be locked out of what is today an internet/digital driven society. And if that happens, you and I are to blame. Especially me — us — TPG. Am I off base? Let me know. – Mike  Accessibility In Practice: Can Design Thinking Help?  Posted on Thursday, 7 November 2013 by Sarah Horton  Category: Strategy   Here at TPG we do a great deal of work helping organizations remediate accessibility issues with their web sites and web applications. It’s very satisfying work — particularly when we do regression testing on a site or app and the issues are resolved. But we also work helping organizations with their design and development processes, helping integrate accessibility into practice so there’s no need to remediate or regression test. In this sense, if we are successful in our work, we will have consulted our way out of a job! It’s difficult to audit an organization. There are no widely held organizational standards we can measure against the same way we can measure web accessibility against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). And each organization has its own culture, processes, and openness to change. Unlike adding alt text to an image, incorporating accessibility into practice requires profound changes that affect everyone in the organization. Some organizations add accessibility into the QA process or include users with disabilities in usability testing. These steps are important and valuable, and produce incremental improvements. But we believe accessibility needs to be part of the discussion from the start of a project and considered at every step along the way. We believe everyone on the project team has a role to play in supporting accessibility, and that the necessary knowledge and skills must be required of every team member. Innovating with a Practice of Accessibility In “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” Clayton Christensen talks about sustaining technologies and disruptive technologies. Sustaining technologies improve products in ways that are historically valued; disruptive technologies are innovations that introduce a new value proposition and, when successful, produce new ideas and better ways of doing things. If we consider accessibility as a “product,” an organization that has made a commitment to accessibility is likely putting forth a disruptive idea, in that accessibility may not be valued across the organization—at least not enough to drive the changes needed to make it part of practice. In addition, accessibility may introduce changes to a product line that are not widely valued by customers. The “dilemma” is that organizations that approach such disruptions with business-as-usual thinking are likely to fail. Innovative ideas need an innovation process. “Design thinking” might be a good approach to take with organizational changes as disruptive as establishing a practice of accessibility. Design thinking is an approach to problem solving that was popularized by Tim Brown from IDEO. His book, “Change by Design,” provides rationale and methodologies for using the types of activities we typically associate with design for other types of decision-making. One of the design thinking concepts we are working with is the idea of prototyping and iterating. Rather than reworking policies, position responsibilities, training efforts, development methods, and accountability to support accessibility in practice across the board, throughout an organization, we propose to create a model for one project or project team, execute the model, and evaluate and refine the model until it works. Then we would look to applying the working model across the larger organization. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to integrating accessibility into an organization. As consultants and partners, we need to tailor our approach to fit the needs and culture of the organization. We believe this “accessibility in practice pilot” approach has a greater chance of bringing about the fundamental changes needed to bring everyone on board with accessibility. What are your thoughts on accessibility in practice?  What’s Happenning at The Paciello Group?  Posted on Thursday, 10 July 2014 by Mike Paciello  Category: Strategy   In addition to client work we do at The Paciello Group we like to keep our clients and colleagues abreast of our contributions to the international accessibility and web standards work. I’m personally very proud of our team and their individual contributions as we continue to drive accessibility and raise the bar in quality of user experience for people with disabilities!

JavaScript touch/pointer events research notes: screenreaders, faked mouse events, touchscreens by Patrick Lauke Over the last two years I’ve been dabbling with various aspects related to the handling of touch events and pointer events – specifically trying to determine which events are being dispatched by browsers as a result of touchscreen interactions, and what the repercussions of this are considering the increasing number of multi-input devices    Accessibility and the Web of Things (WoT)  Posted on Monday, 9 January 2017 by Graeme Coleman  Category: DevelopmentCategory: Standards   My colleague Adrian Roselli and I recently joined the W3C Web of Things (WoT) Interest Group, so I thought I should provide a summary of what we mean when we talk about the “web of things” and the implications, as well as opportunities, for accessibility. The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has been the subject of discussion in industry, academia, and in the lay press for a number of years. IoT refers to the inter-networking of unique “things” (which can be real/physical or digital/virtual) within the existing internet infrastructure. The aim is to allow the sharing of data between entities without necessarily requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer intervention. WoT expands this concept by concentrating not only on how things are connected, but also on how existing web standards, specifications, and platform independent application programming interfaces (APIs) can be embedded to ensure interoperability and shared semantics across different platforms. Consequently, rather than spending time building a proprietary networking solution, developers can concentrate their efforts on the actual “things”, thus increasing the possibility of introducing them to market more quickly. As the web expands beyond the browser and into everyday objects and environments, a host of new challenges and opportunities are introduced. Many related concepts — such as technological, regulatory, security and privacy concerns — have been discussed at length and are still evolving. We see our role as examining the implications of the WoT for accessibility, and by extension for accessibility practitioners and researchers. We believe the WoT opens up many benefits for accessibility. For example, consider a set of household appliances. Operating such appliances may be difficult or even impossible for a visually impaired person, or a person with limited mobility or another physical impairment. However, let’s assume that each appliance is connected via wifi, shares a platform independent API, and is “paired” with a single host application on a smartphone or tablet. The person, who may already be familiar and comfortable with their own device, can therefore operate each appliance through this application, using the device’s built-in assistive technologies where necessary. The WoT is not limited to physical devices, or even connected physical devices. For example, a WoT-enabled device could assist in wayfinding and navigation by warning a person who is blind or has a visual impairment of nearby hazards, or help them to find their destination. A WoT-enabled device may also enable this same person to take part in an activity or event that would otherwise not be available to them — for example, taking part in a sport such as soccer by providing information in a multimodal way, such as where the goal is and any nearby opposition players or teammates. A person with a hearing impairment watching a movie at the cinema or at home with the family may be able to access the movie’s captions on a suitable device without the need for captions to be physically presented on the screen. In short, the WoT can be used to promote independence, where dependence on another human being or an expensive proprietary device has erstwhile been necessary. There are, of course, many challenges to overcome to reach such solutions. From a technical perspective, the metadata describing the data and interaction models must be exposed in an accessible manner to take into account the many different ways that a person may be interacting with the device. Can the metadata be interpreted correctly, and subsequently be conveyed, by assistive technologies? Are the APIs malleable enough to deal with all the different methods of interaction, and can they deal with new versions of assistive technologies introduced to the market? Despite these challenges, we believe the WoT offers significant potential for disabled people, and we are excited by the opportunities.

       "' Accessible ComicsPublished 7 August 2018, by Hampus SethforsA lot of the accessibility initiatives today are focused on web sites and apps. But there’s of course more to the digital world than that. In this article we’ll look at a case where a team has done great work to make their digital comic accessible to people with visual impairments.Let’s start with a small experiment!Imagine a blind person.What image pops up in your head?Is it a young person? Is the person at their work? Doing sports? At the cinema? Buying an Apple Watch? Reading a comic? Probably not.There are many preconceived ideas out there about what people with disabilities do, or rather don’t do. If you don’t have a visual impairment yourself or some blind friends, you probably don’t think of blind people in the above situations. Most people tend to think of an old person with a cane, not doing much. Which of course is a problem that for instance affects how people are treated, job recruitment and which products are made accessible.So we need to get more people to see people with disabilities as a diverse group with all sorts of jobs, interests and hobbies. And we need to get more people to understand that their users have disabilities, which is what the article “Our users have no disabilities” is all about.Making a comic accessibleWith this in mind, I was pleasantly surprised when the team behind a comic contacted us, asking for advice on the style of alt-texts for their comic: 100 Demon Dialogues.Sidenote: this might seem like a sponsored article, but it’s not. We’re just thrilled to see the great job this team has done and want to share it with you!Most people would never think about making a comic accessible for people with visual impairments. After all, comics are very visual.But the author Lucy Bellwood – in the image above – is more inclusive than most people. She wanted to make her comic accessible to comic lovers with visual impairments as well, and brought a team together to get it done. So they asked us to review a couple of alt-texts they had written. It turned out that they’d already grasped the concept very well so our advice was basically: “Great job, keep doing what you’re doing. And can we write about this when it’s out?”And now the comic is out. We tested it with a screen reader – an assistive technology that speaks alt-texts to the user – and the experience is awesome.So below are two short, short videos.An inaccessible experience of a regular comic where the screen reader just says “Background” when it tries to read the content.The accessible 100 Demon Diaries comic that reads the well crafted alt-texts, which both explain what’s happening visually in the comic and what’s written in text.It’s so great seeing people making their products accessible, especially when barely anyone else in their field are doing it. Hopefully it motivates more people to do the same thing and opens more people’s minds as to the diverse interests of people with disabilities!If you’re as happy with this initiative as we are please spread the word about this and give the author Lucy Bellwood (@LuBellWoo) and her team with Kate Brednow, Andy McMillan (@andymcmillan) and Jason Alderman (@justsomeguy) a shoutout on Twitter.I also strongly recommend the Tumblr A11y Wins – a site that’s dedicated to showcasing positive accessibility examples.If you want to check out the comic, you can find it in the following places:Search for “100 demon dialogues” in iBooks.AmazonGumroadGet notified when we write new stuffAbout once a week we write an article about accessibility or usability, that’s just as awesome as this one (#HumbleBrag)!Get notified by following us on Twitter @AxessLab or Facebook.Or simply drop your email below!Email  Email  Get notified!'"
